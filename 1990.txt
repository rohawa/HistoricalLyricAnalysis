Janie got a gun
Her whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun

What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?

They found him underneath the train
But man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun

Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run

Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain

Run away, run away from the pain

And put a bullet in his brain
She said 'cause nobody believes me
The man was such a sleaze, he ain't
Never gonna be the same

Jimmie Rodgers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis, the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby is in the heart of every school girl
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Every word of every song that he sang was for you
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon
What could you do?

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

If you please
If you please
If you pleaseHere I am at six o'clock in the morning
Still thinking about you
It's still hard, at six o'clock in the morning
To sleep without you

And I know that it might
Seem too late for love
All I know

I need you now
More than words can say
I need you now
I've got to find a way
I need you now
Before I lose my mind
I need you now

Here I am, I'm looking out my window
I'm dreaming about you
Can't let you go, at six o'clcok in the morning
I feel you beside me

And I know that it might
Seem too late for love
For love Oh, Oh, Oh

I need you now
More than words can say
I need you now
I've got to find a way
I need you now
Before I lose my mind
I need you now
More than words can say
I need you now
Oh I got to hear you say
I need you now
Before I lose my mind
I need you now
I need you nowGirl, sometimes it seems to me
That I don't say the things I should, 
To you, I act like I'm no good
And you, wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you, 
It takes two hearts to share

Your eyes will always see through me, 
And bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, 
You're everything I need

And through the good and bad times, 
You have always been there
We hold each other close, 
You tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, 
Never dream of givin' up
That's the price of love

Love, sometimes it makes us cry
Forgive me when I get it wrong, 
Sometimes it's hard to be that strong
And oh, I would do anything
For you I'd turn the stars around, 
I'd find a way somehow

This time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again
Love shines, we'll sweep away the past
We're more than lovers, more than friends

And through the good and bad times, 
You have always been there
We hold each other tight, 
You tell me it's alright
The nights we fight about it, 
Never think of givin' up
That's the price of love

Your eyes will always see through me, 
And bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, 
You're everything I need

And through the good and bad times, 
You have always been there
We hold each other close, 
You tell me it's alright
And sometimes I can't give enough, 
That's the price of love

That's the price of love, that's the price of love
That's the price of love...Take a good look at me

Relationships they seem from the start

When love is not together from the heart

Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison poison

If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I start to leave fly girl
You know 'cause in some portions
You'll think she's the best thing in the world

She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' dreamin'

Poison deadly moving it slow
Looking for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Getting paid laid so better lay low

How do you know me and the crew used to do her

And that night I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas the highs the lows
Keepin' one eye open still clockin' 'em
Still one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be how how is she
Michael me and see and I'm runnin' the show

You'll pull me through, whoa, baby

Tell me what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever
Was gone with one touch of your hand, oh girl

If I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see, whoa, baby
Once that I found you there was no letting go

Tell me what kind of man would I be?

But if I had to live without you

Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart (astronomical)
Groove is in the heart (hit me!)

Watch out!

The depth of hula groove
Moves into the nth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who
I couldn't ask for another (I-I-I-I)
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul (Soul!) was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just dee-lovely and delicious

C'mon, y'all are... y'all are crazy, manWhen I had you
I treated you bad
Wrong my dear
But since, since you went away
Don't you know I sit around
With my head hanging down
And I wonder who's loving you

Ooh, my first mistake was
I wanted too much time
I had to have him morning, noon, and night
If I would of known then
The things that I know now
I might not have lost the time I complain about

Don't waste your time
Fighting blind minded thoughts of despair
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love
Ooh, ooh, baby hold on
Hold on to your love
You gotta hold on
Hold on to your love

The art of playing games now
Is not the hearts you break
It's bound to good love you make
When it's heart's on fire
Give him love everyday
Remember he needs space
Be patient and he'll give his heart to you

Trust and honesty too
Must be the golden rule
You'll feel the strength of passion in your soul
Burn so deeply within
Ooh, the magic that you share
So sacrifice and show how much you care

Ad lib:
Keep the ties
Hang on tight
And don't let go
No, no, no, no
If you need him
Just keep on
Just keep on hanging on
Little trust, honesty, golden rules
Feel the strength of passion in your soul
It's burning so deep
Have faith
Just keep the fire burning at home
Hey yeah
He'll come home to you
He'll be there for you
He'll want to have you

FadeWoah, yeah
Do do do, oh

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Do, do, do, oh
Mmm, woah yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
Woah yeahBetter make tracks fast on the double
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothin' but trouble - Oh!

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude
Leads you on, then leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?

One day she'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her
In the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

She gets you hot then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
'Cause she knows you'll always give her one more try
You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playin' to the crowd
But tell me, do you really like standin' in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie (that would be a lie)
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

Jump in
One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I've tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this here as a dis and a goodbye

She ain't worth it, even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry, 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy, but she's nothin' but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, ooh
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me (I know) I know better than
(Better than) better than (bet-bet) better than you

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you
(puttin' you) Puttin' you through

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth itIt was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, "Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can"

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knewYour face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand
I care about you
So much about you, baby
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh no
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way that you want me to

(I don't have the heart) Ooh
Baby, I don't have the heart, I don't have the heart
(I don't have the heart) Ooh
Baby, I don't have

(I don't have the heart)
(I don't have the heart)
(I don't have the heart)Ain't no personal thing, boy
But you have got to stay away
Far, far away from my heart, my heart
Don't you know what your kiss is doing
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
Baby

You've been hanging around, boy
And you have started sinking in
Whoa, baby you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it to you one more time, boy

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end

I learned something about myself
(Last night)
Last night with you I knew
I didn't want nobody else
And you're scaring me to death now, baby

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end

No

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good

Never 'round to love me, you're always gone,
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you

(You're a rebel now) Don't give a damn
(Always carrying on) With the gang
(I'm trying to tell you, boy) It's a mistake
(You won't realize) till it's too late

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of livin' such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong, but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

You're so together, boy, but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Schemin', plannin' lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

(Don't you tell yourself) That it's okay
(Sick and tired of) All of your games
(And you want me to stay) Ah, better change
(Makes no sense to me) Your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of livin' such a dangerous life, hoo
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die

I feel so all alone
Can't find the joy
You know that I'd be with you now
If I had the choice
I know I hurt you when I said goodbye
And I don't know the reason
I ever stopped believing
I never needed anyone but you, oh

I was too blind to see
When you belonged to me
You were my everything
Now I'd give anything
To feel the love you bring
You were my everything

They say time can mend a broken heart
And fix you up
But my life will never, ever be the same
Without your touch
I know you're still afraid to let me in
And I don't blame you really
I wouldn't let you see me
I took for granted you would always be there

I know I hurt you when I said goodbye
And I don't know the reason
I ever stopped believing
I never needed anyone but you

You were my love
You were my everything

Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind, yeah

They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win

Well, they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mr. Catch Me If You Can

I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
And Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun

You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well, I ask if I'll grow old

You ask me if I've known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun
Yeah

Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep

Lord, I got to ask a favor
And I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let the boy die like a man
Staring down the bullet
Let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son

Call me young gun
I'm a young gun, yeah
Young gun, yeah, yeah, yeah

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was, oh, oh, so bad
And I don't think he's coming back, mm mm

He gave the reason, the reasons he should go
And he said a thing he hadn't said before

I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love

She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love, oh love

(Have you seen her?)

At a game, on Different World or the Cosby Show
(Have you seen her?)

At the track, at the club, or out buying dub

Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?

Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Laverette, or my homey Rob Base

If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, Veo on the phone

Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homey won't you help a young brother
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)

The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like Houdini be magic, and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face

I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love

Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ
(Have you seen her? tell me have you seen her? have you seen her?)That's word, we pray, pray, pray

VogueI had it all, but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone, ooh

Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete, yeah
Lord, I'm needing you now, tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly, woah

Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone

You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care, oh
You might say you don't miss me, you don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do inside

Oh, love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
To let you go

I can't escape the pain inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there alone, oh ohTreated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me

It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized a dream
And I visualized the love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that Heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny (all that I did)
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

(Prayed through the nights) Prayed through the nights
(So faithfully) So faithfully (faithfully)
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to beShe was a jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' me 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream (dream)
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you do
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (huh)
And show you the way I feel (huh huh huh)

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back or she too far
Windin' me up just to let her down
So emotional, gagged and bound

There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the full moon rising, I was scared
I think I was possessed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (huh huh huh huh huh huh)
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Every time your body's next to mine
Something deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She got an attitude I can't explain
You never know if you're in frame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on the countdown till I get heard

Her blood was hot, she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you (huh huh huh huh)

(I just wanna be close to you)
She was a jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear

I just wanna be close to you (I just wanna be close to you, baby)
And show you the way I feel

I wanna be close to you (baby)
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feelI could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

Oh, without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is goneHow can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Look at us now, look at us baby
Still trying to work it out, never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy
Oh... when there's no comunication
Oh... it's a no win situation

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we've got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Oh... ain't it time we started trying
Oh... gotta stop this love from dying

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Baby love is tough but we can take it
How can we be lovers
Baby times are rough but we can make it
We can work it out

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friendsThe game of love is to live it up
And baby not too high.
Don't you know, if you wanna get down with Mister P
You gotta go and let your backbone slide.
What feeling when you push it up, push it down.
You gotta push it up, push it down. Feel good.
George Michael or Marvin Gaye
It still is the same in you.
Baby don't tease. Ooh, just please
'Cause you know it's just me and you.
All or nothing, push, it's got to be.
Something's gotta show when you're livin' under heat.
All or nothing, push, girl, let it be.
Take it from the pro who's rockin' to the beat.
I'm under heat oh baby, please take it slow.
Give me some time and maybe, our love will grow.
I want to suit you baby and make it right.
Take it from me babe, I wanna rock all night.
If it's good for me, it's good for you.
You gotta never let your mood get dry.
Just keep it wet and my seven forty jet
Is pushing right on high.

On my lips my sweet bumble bee.
Sting me like I knew you could.
All or nothing, push, it's got to be.
Something's gotta show when you're lyin' under me.
Oh, oh, nothin' girl, let it be.
Take it from the pro, who's rockin' to the beat.(Here she comes) 
Mmm, just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

(There she goes) 
She don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight?
I'll do all I can
Till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth that should keep us apart
Baby

I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love
Mmm, your love

(So I wait) 
Here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
Can't go on living this way
Baby

I've been on the outside looking in
Bring my tears to an end, oh
I realize there's no use for me to pretend

I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone

But don't you take too long babyShe calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep.
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, mmm hmm
Think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
Paradise
Just think about it
Paradise
Just think about
Paradise
Paradise
ParadiseWe never talked about it but I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry,
But I wouldn't want to waste your time
'Cause I love you, but I can't take anymore
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies?
Do you remember?

There seemed no way to make up,
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me,
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side,
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go
Do you remember?

Through all of my life,
In spite of all the pain
You know that people are funny sometimes,
'Cause they just can't wait to get hurt again,
Tell me do you remember?

There are things we won't recall,
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it,
'Cause we never seemed to have the time
There was always something more important to do,
More important to say
But "I love you" wasn't one of those things,
And now it's too late
Do you remember?You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend... yeah
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I... ooh now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh I guess you were right... yeah
Ooh I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again... yeah

Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh girl I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh yes I wish it would rain on me

Though your hurt is gone, mine's hanging on inside... and I know
Well it's eating me through, it's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign

'Cause I know, I know... I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I've let you down... oh yeah
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no

And now I... now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me
Oh you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh yes I wish it would rain down, down on me
Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me... just rain down over me

Just let it rain down, let it rain down, let it rain down... oh yeah
Let it rain down, rain down over me
Just let it rain down, just let it rain down, let it rain down
Just let it rainWe had a life, we had a love
But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry (how many times)
Yes I'm sorry

How can something so good go so bad
How can something so right go so wrong
But I don't know, I don't have all the answers
But I want you back
Now how many times can I say I'm sorry (how many times)
Well you know...

You can run, and you can hide
But I'm not leaving less you come with me
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, please believe in me

I only wanted someone to love
But something happened on the way to heaven
It got a hold of me and wouldn't let go
And I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry (how many times)
Oh yes I'm sorry (sorry)
Well you know...

You can run, and you can hide

But I'm not leaving 'til it's all over
We've had our problems but I'm on your side
You're all I need, let me show you

They say you can't take it with you
When you go
And I believe it
But taking what I've got or being
Here with you, you know
I'd, I'd rather leave it

We had a life, we had a love
But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back
How many times can I say I'm sorry (how many times)

You're all I need, please believe in meWell I see him on the TV
Preaching about the promised lands
He tells me believe in Jesus
Steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
Lord, I think he sinned, yeah

Twenty two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back

Their bullets took his best friends in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids no regrets
In a time I don't remember
And a war he can't forget
He cried, "Forgive me for what I done there
'Cause I never meant the things I did.

And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise."

My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news

I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

And-give me something to believe in (give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in (give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
Things I didn't know then
Road you gotta take me home

I drive by the homeless sleepin' on a cold dark street
Like bodies in an old bone grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
Used to read "Jesus saves"

A mile away live the rich folk
And I see how they're livin' it up
But while the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich are drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose and so few win, hah

Give me something to believe in (give me something to believe in)
Give me something to believe in (give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
Give me something to believe in (give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

Give me something to believe in
You take the high road  (give me something to believe in)
And I'll take the low road

Give me something to believe in
You take the high road  (give me something to believe in)
And I'll take the low road

Give me something to believe in
You take the high road  (give me something to believe in)
And I'll take the low road

Yeah, sometimes I wish I didn't know now
Things I didn't know then, yeah

And give me something to believe inA-what's got you so jumpy?
Why can't you sit still, yeah?
Like gasoline, you wanna pump me

No good, no good, no good, no good
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day, yeah
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
No good, no good, no good, no goodOutside another yellow moon
Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime

The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark

Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one, oh baby
Can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night is just the same
On a downtown train

I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way

And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night its just the same
You leave me lonely

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
Every night, every night its just the same

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train?
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
On a downtown train
All my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train
OohHold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.

You pack your bag,
You take control.
You're movin' into my heart
And into my soul.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I won't be walking on thin ice
To get through the night.

Hey, where's your work?
What's your game?
I know your business,
Don't know your name.

Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous.

You turn around,
So hot and dry.
You're hidin' under a halo,
Your mouth is alive.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I'm not attracted to gogo
Deeper tonight.

Hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business,
But I don't know your name.

Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous,
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.

Hey, hey, hey, what's your word?
What's your game?
I know your business,
But I don't know your name.

Hold on tight,
You know she's a little bit dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous.

She's armed and she's extremely dangerous.
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat.
You know she's a little bit dangerous,
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.

Oh, oh oh, hey, where's your work?
Mmm, what's your game?
I don't know your name.
Hey, you!
Ooh, just a little bit dangerous.
I don't know your name.Must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love, but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

(Must have been love) It must have been love
But it's over now
No, no, noIt takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart
You know that it's a shame
But I'm here to ease your pain

There's no need for you to feel so all alone
And you and I could seriously be
A sure enough happening thing
Don't you know that?

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same way, I feel about you
Some call it chemistry
I call it, you should be with me

'Cause I know together we can really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
Don't you know that?

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

I don't believe in fairy tales
But I believe some things were meant to be
Why should we be alone?
When we could have each others arms to hold

'Cause I know together we could really turn this mother out
In my mind there is no doubt
That one and one equals me and you
And don't you know that?

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and youIt's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do."
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to youАмериканская фирма Transceptor Technology

But in a memory, I hear you calling me
Close my eyes and I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday, but then it fades away

Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain (warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true

Now you're gone and I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams, I still feel your touch
Lying next to me, feeling ecstasy

Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain (warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true

I love you madly
I need you badly
Give our love one more chance

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came trueWhen there's clouds hangin' in your sky
And they're just not lettin' any light in
And you feel like you'd like to give in
Don't you give up so soon

What you need is a friend to count on
What you got, baby you got someone
Who will stay when the rain is fallin'
And won't let it fall on you

I'll see you through
I'll cover you with a love so deep and warm and true
I will be there, oh

Honey I'll be your shelter
I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything all right
Make everything all right, yeah

I got arms strong enough to hold you
Get you through anything you go through
Anything that you need you know it's only a touch away

When your heart needs a heart beside it
Should be mine that's it's keeping time with
'Cause I got so much live inside it
It beats for you every day

I'll be the one
To give you love
When it seems like there's just not enough
Mine will be there, oh

Honey I'll be your shelter
I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything all right
Make everything all right, yeah

I'll be your shelter, I'll be you shelter Baby

I'll be the one to take you through the night
Whenever you need shelter
I'll make everything all right
Make everything all right, yeah

(Chorus repeat until fade out)Saying goodbye
Is never an easy thing
But you never said that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time that we'll be together

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
Darling I know, I know this will be

Sometimes it takes some time out on your own now
To find your way back home

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days our love will lead you back, oh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cause in my heart I know, oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again

To love with every beat
I just wanna know you
More every day
And now it won't be long

Say that you do boy
It's just a matter of time
Before you know it
You'll feel the fire
And it's burning deep inside
You'll find the answer
In his eyes
With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know we're getting closer to love
With every beat of my heart
I feel you moving closer to me, oh

Whistling air
Whispering in my ear

Boy mercury shooting through every degree
Oh girl dancing down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip rocking through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the air-strip to the sunset 
Yeah ride the arrow to the target
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Fly the great big sky see the great big sea
Kick through continents bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world 
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wildernessSo long that I've waited for a girl
To come into my life and in my world
I can't explain my feelings for you
I guess you're just all my dreams come true

And I'll be your lover (your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, I'll be your friend)
I'll be there when you're needing me (when you need me)
I'll be your everything, your everything

I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll be all that you want and all that you need
I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me
I'll be your everything

Now that we're together at last
We shouldn't think about our problems in the past
'Cause true love takes a miracle to find
I guess that I've been blessed 'cause I've got you by my side

And I'll be your lover (your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, I'll be your friend)
I'll be there when you're needing me (when you need me)
I'll be your everything, your everything

I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me
I'll be your everything

When you're lost and you're down and you're seeing darkness
And there's no one there that can be found
Just turn around, I'll be there holding out my arms for you
Just reach for me, I'll be the one to set you free

I'll be your everything
I'll be all that you want and all that you need
I'll lift you up when you're feeling down
I'll make your whole world turn around

To let you know this love is true

Ooh, I'll be your everythingYo, VIP, let's kick it

Ice Ice Baby
Ice Ice Baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance! Go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony

Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon

Burning 'em if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo

Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say, "hi"
Did you stop? No, I just drove by

Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo
So, I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue

Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack

Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene, just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground

'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this

Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, "Damn"
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram

Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice Ice Baby
(Vanilla) Ice

The way it's supposed to be
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart

I don't wanna think about it, don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze what I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive, reckless
And lose myself in your kiss

Arrows through hearts, drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain
My heart is beating, don't say no
My head keeps saying, take it slow

I don't wanna think about it, don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze what I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive, reckless
And lose myself in your kiss

You're giving me a feeling, it's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment, spontaneous
Whoa-whoa, oh, this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

I am reckless (reckless), impulsive

I never imagined you could, blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart
My heart

I don't wanna think about it, don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze what I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive, reckless
And lose myself in your kiss

You're giving me a feeling, it's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment, spontaneous
Wanna be impulsive, reckless
And lose myself in your kiss, whoa

Impulsive
I wanna be impulsive
I'm gonna be impulsive, reckless
And lose myself, lose myselfI know, that it's time for a change, mmm
But when that change comes
Will it still feel the same?

How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground (ground, ground, ground)
Can you release me?
Can you release me?

Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh if you'd have come down
From your high, would we've been all right?
Release me
Can you release me?

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy

Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That, baby, you've just got to release me

Release me
Release me

I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing though very slow
So stop coming around my door (door, door)
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for
Whoa-oh, oh yeah

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy

Oh oh oh, baby
Come on, darlin', now hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That, baby, you've just got to release me

What is this power you've got on me? (What is this power)
What is this power (What is it? What is it?)

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy

Just a love that's well designed
For passing the test of time

*Repeat until fade*From a distance, the world looks blue and green,
And the snow capped mountains white.
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream,
And the eagle takes to flight.

From a distance, there is harmony,
And it echoes through the land.
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man.

From a distance, we don't have enough,
And no one is in need.
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease,
No hungry mouse to feed.

From a distance, we are instruments
Marching in a common band.
Playing songs of hope, 
Playing songs of peace.
They're the songs of every man.

God is watching us. 
God is watching us.
God is watching us 
From a distance.

From a distance, you look like my friend,
Even though we are at war.
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for.

From a distance, there is harmony,
And it echoes through the land.
And it's the hope of hopes, 
It's the love of loves,
It's the heart of every man.
It's the hope of hopes, 
It's the love of loves.
This is the song of every man.

And God is watching us, 
God is watching us,
God is watching us 
From a distance.
Oh, God is watching us, 
God is watching.
God is watching us 
From a distance.Ooh, ooh, ooh

People are talking, talking 'bout people
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers kept under cover
I just ignore it but they keep saying we
Laugh just a little too loud
Stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they're seein' something we don't, darling

Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about, babe
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?

I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
It took the rumor to make me wonder
Now I'm convinced I'm going under
Thinking 'bout you every day
Dreaming 'bout you every night
I'm hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, darling

Let's give 'em something to talk about
A little mystery to figure out, babe
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?

Let's give 'em something to talk about, babe
A little mystery to figure out
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?

Ooh, listen to 'em baby
A little mystery won't hurt 'em
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about our love, love, love, loveMotownphilly's back again

Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
Off the mic with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm, jump

And I'm here to combine beats and lyrics
To make you shake your pants, take a chance
Come on and dance, guys, grab a girl
Don't wait, make the twirl

It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Trying to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so you, what's up
Hands in the air, come on, say yeah

Everybody over here everybody over there
The crowd is live enough as I pursue this groove
Party people in the house
Move (Left to right)
Move (Work me all night)

Let the music take control of your heart and soul
Unfold your body is free and behold

A time to turn over
A better life for you and me (You and me)

A new recreation
To channel all this energy
Let's solve the equation
I need to keep you close to me

So, baby, let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me, baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong

'Cause love will take over
And leave you out of sight and mind (Sight and mind)
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind

And, baby, let your conscience go

Touch me all night long

Hold me, baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night longSo much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed, I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keeping your heart next to mine

But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?

Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger of the endless dream

I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?

Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Where do all the lonely hearts go?

Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?

Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Ohoho!

I need someone to give my heart to
I feel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger, yeah, yeah

And I feel inside
Hearts are made to last till the end of timeDream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever

These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelievable

Oh!
(What the?)
(What the fuck was that?)

You burden me with your problems
By telling me more than mine
I'm always so concerned
With the way you say you've always go to stop

To think of us being one
Is more than I ever know
But this time, I realize
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelievable

Oh!
(What the?)
(What the?)
(What the?)
(What the fuck was that?)

Seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times
Pushing down the better few
Instead of bringing out the clues
To want the world and everything your asked to
Brace yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems
(What the fuck was that?)
(It's unbelievable)

You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
But don't listen to my replies

You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
It's why I love you more

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelievable

Oh!
(What the?)
(What the?)
You're so unbelievable

(What the?)
(What the?)
You're unbelievable

(It's unbelievable)
Oh!
(What the?)
(What the?)
(What the?)
(What the fuck was that?)
You're unbelievableOoh yeah, wooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Life's ambition occupies my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness, one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find

Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
That a circle can't fit where a square should be

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do

Hole hearted
Hole hearted

This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay kept warm inside
Day by day, less satisfied
Not fade away before I die

Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I'm not blind why can't I see
Oh, that a circle can't fit where a square should be

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can't be filled with the things I do

There's a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
I'd fall short with the things I do

Hole hearted
Hole hearted
Hole hearted
Hole hearted
Hole hearted
Hole hearted, yeahSaying "I love you"
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying "I love you"

La-di-da-da-di-da-di-da-da-da
More than words
La-di-da-di-da

Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you

La-di-da-da-di-da-da-da-da
More than words
La-di-da-da-di-da-da-da-da
More than words
La-di-da-da-di-da-da-da-da
More than words
La-di-da-da-di-da-da-da-da
La-da-da more than words

Ooh
More than wordsI guess the time was right for us to say
We'd take our time and live our lives together day by day
We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
We know our dreams can all come true
With love that we can share

With you I never wonder, will you be there for me?
With you I never wonder, you're the right one for me

I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart, I finally found the love of a lifetime

With every kiss our love is like brand-new
And every star up in the sky was made for me and you
Still we both know that the road is long
(But) We know that we will be together
Because our love is strong

I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart, I finally found the love of a lifetime

Ooh, I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through, ooh
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart, I finally found the love

Let's talk about the time
(I finally found the love of a lifetime)
Love, that you feel back in time
(I finally found the love of a lifetime)
I'm feeling so much love
(I finally found the love of a lifetime)
Ooh, forever in my heart
I finally found the love of a lifetimeWhy be afraid if I'm not alone
Though life is never easy the rest in unknown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now and it's shining on me
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me, you're sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step I'll make it through, I know I can
It may not make it easier
But I have felt you near all the way

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now and it's shining on me
(I see the light, I see the light) See the light
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me, you're sharing with me

(Forever, forever) I stand on the rock of your love
Forever I'll stand on the rock
Ever, ever, can't nobody stop me
(Forever, forever) I stand on the rock of your
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

Coming out of the dark
I finally see the light now and it's shining on me
(I see the light, I see the light) See the light
Coming out of the dark
I know the love that saved me, you're sharing, you're sharing with me
Sharing with me, sharing with me, sharing with me

Coming out of the dark
Coming out of the dark
Coming out of the dark, see the light now
Yes, I see the lightYeah, yeah
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I like the way
I, I like, I like the way
I like the way

All summer long we've been together
And I never felt so good
'Cause when I'm with you
It's such a good time, yes it is

And when you get next to me
You make my heart beat fast
You throw me back when you smile
And when we're alone, I know we're in love
'Cause I can't get enough

'Cause (I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day

We got it good, we have it all it seems
We're living dream, yeah
This is our time, this was just meant to be
Just you and me

This is still new
We're still young and hearts can break in two
But I know our love
Will always be there

(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day, baby yeah

(I like the way) You and me, yeah
(I like the way) I just like the way you kiss me
(I like the way) Touch you and squeeze you
(I like the way)Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove 'em wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy, it's you I can't do without

I feel better when I have you near me
'Cause no other love around
Has quite the same ooh, ooh (ha ha)
Like you do, do-do-do, babe

They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove 'em wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

Oh, do without you
Love would never do without you
Whoo
Do without you

Never do without you...
Ooh...
Ooh!
Ooh!
C'mon!

(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Again!
(Love will never do!) Sing! (Never do without you!) Do it for me, now!

(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
What?

(They said it, they said it wouldn't last)
(They said it, they said it wouldn't last)
(They said it, they said it wouldn't last) What do you want?
(They said it, they said it wouldn't last) If you believe in love, sing!

(Love will never do, love will never do without you)
(Love will never do, love will never do without you)

They said it wouldn't last (last...), we had to prove them wrong, (wrong...)
'Cause I've learned in the past that love will never do without you... (Love will, love will, just won't do without...)
We had to prove them wrong,
'Cause I've learned in the past that love will never do without you... (Just won't do without you...)
We had to prove them wrong,
'Cause I've learned in the past that love will never do without you... (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)

They said it...
They said it...I think I know what you mean
And although it sounds obscene
I will always do my best to understand
You have so many words
And your voice is always heard
But who can say they really understand? 

Real, real, real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know

Well you say you have a big love
And it really sounds like fun
If I knew what it was
Then I'm sure I'd like to have one
Give me a sign that you
Feel some emotion

Real, real, real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know

Say what you like you know that no-one
Really minds
And if there's nothing to say, then
Why don't we all go away? 

Do you real-
Do you real-
Do you really feel real?

Real, real, real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know

But if there's nothing to say, then
Why don't we all go away? 

Real, real, real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real? 
And if so I'd like to know

Do you real-

We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again

I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, oh baby
I've been thinking about you, ooh (shi-pow-pow)

Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay

Deep down, I'm still confused about you
Oh, yes I am, baby
I feel so in love
Oh baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, oh yeah
I've been thinking about you, got you on my mind

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
Oh, I'm thinking about you, got you on my mind

(Shi-pow-pow)
(Shi-pow-pow)

What good is being here without you?

Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, ooh yeah
I've been thinking about you, oh

I've been thinking about you
You and me baby, I'm been thinkin' 'bout you all the time
I've been thinking about youI wanna kiss you in Paris
I wanna hold your hand in Rome
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm

Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

I want to know you
Not like that
I don't wanna be your mother
I don't wanna be your sister either

I just wanna be your lover
I wanna be your baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Talk to me - tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears

Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!

Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I wanna be your baby

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting, to justify

Waiting, to justify my love
Praying, to justify
To justify my love
I'm open, to justify my loveYou've got me feeling emotions
And higher, higher, higher

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

Feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Now in the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

Feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Oh, you emotions
Oh, deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Baby, you've got me feelin' emotions
Higher than the heavens above, oh yeah yeah

Now you know the way 
To make me lose control
When you're lookin' into my eyes
You make me feel so

Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you've got me feelin' emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you emotions

High emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you, emotions, emotions
You got me feelin' higherOnce again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become

We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When we only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, hey

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone

Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
Ooh, I don't wanna cry, no oh yeah

All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

'Cause I don't wanna cry
Don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul) Ooh
And I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul) Ooh baby
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry

I don't wanna cry, mmm
I don't wanna cryHey, hey, hey, hey

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, "I just don't need her now."
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known

Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

(Someday, ooh someday)
(One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for)
(Someday, hey, hey)
(Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause) baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only

But when you're down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

SomedayYeah

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend, if he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way, it oughta be, hey

Well, this man loves you, woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause, baby, baby, ooh

When a man loves a woman, oh
When a man loves a woman, yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman
OohDo anything

Just can't
Just can't get
Just can't get enough
Talk to me

Hey I really love you
Love you so so much
Put my lady next to you
To always feel your touch
Every little thing you do
Seems to turn me on
Even when you're talking nasty to me
Over the telephone

Honey I'll stay up late for you
And wait for your call
Buzz me up at 5 AM
And I don't mind at all

'Cause I'll do anything for your loving
Yes I'll do anything
But with a serious step are you qualified?

Just can't
Just can't get
Just can't get enough
Talk to me

First thing in the morning
I'll be at your door
Oh tough
All day long and
All night strong
Just can't get enough

Honey if you let me start you up
We can begin
I play your game
Every time
Baby won't you let me win

'Cause I'll do anything for your loving
Do anything for your loving
Or would you send me off like a third class lover
Do anything for your loving 'til the break of dawn
Do anything for your loving baby on

Just can't
Just can't get
Just can't get enough
Talk to me

You got to know
The way I feel
Is for real
It's everlasting

And I'll take heed
And lead you in the right direction for affection
See what I'm saying
I ain't playin'
Stop delayin' girl
And make me your natural selection

Ha ha ha ha
You're crazy
I don't know about you
But I think I like you

Do anything for your lovin'

Could you find the time to make me yours?
Take me out and rock the floors?
Give me every little bit of your loves what I said
Make it smooth to the groove
Like sandwich bread

Well it's you for me
And me for you
There's not one thing
I wouldn't do
Hey I'll do most anything
You and me were meant to swing
Swing

You can reach me on an airplane, you can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

You can reach me by sailboat, climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt, cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer

(Interlude, then repeat bridge)

You can windsurf into my life, take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon, but you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

I don't care, I don't care, I need you right here right now

I need you right here, right now, right by my side (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you canOoh, na na na
Ooh, na na na

You're the whisper of a summer breeze
You're the kiss that puts my soul at ease
What I'm sayin' is I'm into you
Here's my story and the story goes

You give love
You get love

It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper 
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dreamListen baby, don't even waste your tears, on that insensitivity
There's better things for you
I know what you really need
Someone who cares
Someone who's gonna be there for you
Someone like me, baby
Someone with sensitivity

Girl, I know it's been hard since he went away
And left you so sad that you cry everyday
Let me kiss your tears erase all your doubts
Because for you I'm here, you won't be without
Love
Don't need a man who can give you money
Com' on let me show you just what you need honey (I got what you need)
Don't need a man who can give you money
You need a man with sensitivity
A man like me

Someone who can love you
Someone who will need you
Someone who will treat you right (like me girl)
Someone who can hold at night
Someone stable in your life (ah baby)
You need a man with sensitivity
A man like me (baby) (honey)

Baby and I'm the man (ah you know, you know)
Honey like I do baby (hang on in their baby)
You need a man with sensitivity
A man like me

See you need someone who's their like a gentleman
If anybody can fit the description baby I can
Someone who cares and dares to give himself completely
You got it in me you need a man with sensitivity

You need a man
Not any man
Warm and sensitive that's what I can give
Warm and sensitive that's what I can give
Warm and sensitive that's what I can give
Man with sensitivity
A man like me

Someone who can love you
Someone who will need you
Someone who will treat you right (like me girl)
Someone who can hold at night
Someone stable in your life (ah baby)
You need a man with sensitivity
A man like me (baby) (honey)

Save a little love for me (sensitivity)
Baby I got what you need (I got it)

Hold on my darling
Don't let me down

(Chorus till fade)Sitting in my bedroom the rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window and loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing says don't you stay inside
But I can't fight this feeling got L.U.S.T. on my mind

I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely but is she N.A.S.T.Y?

P.A.S.S.I.O.N.
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.

Her lips are callin' to me no way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle we set our bodies free
And while the music played on she loved me down from A to Z

The night is getting longer I start to realize
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y.
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back the S.E.X. is just too good

P.A.S.S.I.O.N.
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.

Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I should've read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind I must have been blind

I never knew another lover that was evil under cover
Then I discovered you girl, you're like no other
Doin' the time for the crime I was blind
To the games that you were playin'
Words that you were sayin'
Goin' out of my mind, you're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact, you got the knack to drop a man to his knees

P.A.S.S.I.O.N.
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.Across the street the river runs
Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover
Of a helicopter blade

Flames are getting higher
In effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still alive
Somewhere, some way
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up!
Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine
Love may still exist
In another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

The rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailingIn a time
Where the Sun descends alone
I ran a long, long way from home
To find a heart that's made of stone

I will try
I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes

Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why
When I scream there's no reply
When I reach out there's nothing to find
When I sleep, I break down and cry (cry) yeah

Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go (can't let go)
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower

Fading like a rose
Fading like a rose
Beaten by the storm (storm)
Talking to myself, getting washed by the rain
It's such a cold, cold town
Ooh such a cold town

Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower

Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go (can't let go)
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a

Every time I see you, oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go (can't let go)
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower (flower)

Ooh...
Ooh... (Every time you leave the room)
I feel I'm fading like a flower (Every time I see you)

Ooh I'm fading like a rose
(Every time you leave the room)
Every time I see you (Every time I see you)

(Every time you leave the room)C'mon, join the joyride, everybody
Get your tickets here
Step right this way

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars

Don't need a book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon

She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you.
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride

She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run

Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no
'Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you.
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride
She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you.
C'mon join the joyride."
Be a joyrider, ow

I'll take you on a sky ride
I'm feeling like I'm spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby

She says, "Hello (hello) you fool (you fool) I love you (I love you).
C'mon join the joyride."
Join the joyride

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
Join the joyride

Hello, hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon, c'mon join the joyride
Be a joyrider
RoxetteI follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

It's just a leap of time
So close into my mind
The heart into the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of changeI got your letter from the postman just the other day
So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel
And let you know my love's for real

Because I love you and I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around

Because I love you, my heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide

If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose your ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I will always be around

Because I love you, my heart's an open door
Girl, won't you please come on in
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guideI looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Two priests on a ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor
For they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor
Than be a fat man in the eye of a needle
As these words were spoken, I swear
I hear the old man laughin'
"What good is a used up world
And how could it be worth havin'?"

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists
Then how come he never lived here?

The teachers told us
The Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple
And an edge of the empire Garrison town
They lived and they died, they prayed to their gods
But the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
They only get better one by one

One by one
One by one by one
One by one

I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Two priests on a ferry
October geese on a cold winter's nightEvery night I say a prayer in the hopes that there's a Heaven
But every day I'm more confused as the saints turn in to sinners
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside, so afraid that I've lost my faith

Show me the way
Show me the way
Take me tonight to the river and wash my illusions away
Please, show me the way

As I slowly drift to sleep for a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news and find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid I just won't know

Show me the way
Show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain and take my confusion away
And show me the way

And if I see your light, should I believe?
Tell me, how will I know?

Show me the way
Show me the way
Take me tonight to river and wash my illusions away
Show me the way
Show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage to believe I will get there someday
And please show me the way

Every night I say a prayer in hopes that there's a HeavenYou know I won't forget the times
We shared together holding hands
And walking in the park

Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I've no regrets

Can't you tell from the look on my face
That I love you more today

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love?
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
The time is moving fast

The love I have for you, time won't ever change
I always feel the same
Now until the end

Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love?
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love?
You looked into my eyes, wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love
Oh when we fell in loveJust want to hold you tight 
All day, all night 
Just want to hold you tight
Just want to hold you tight 
All day, all night 
Just want to hold you tight

I look at you 
You look at me 
And then we smile 
Knowing what we're in for 
The kiss that you give 
Makes me want you more and more 
We're having the time of our lives 

And then you say that 
I will always be the one 
Someone right for your dreams at night 
I wish we could be 
Right here, right now, always 
Touching and loving you so right 

Just want to hold you tight 
All day, all night 
Just want to hold you tight
Just want to hold you tight 
All day, all night 
Just want to hold you tight

Seeing you here by my side 
Words come out that I can't hide 
You're an image of my dreams 

I need you and you need me too 
As long as we keep holding on 
I'll be there for you 

Just want to hold you tight 
All day, all night 
Just want to hold you tight
Just want to hold you tight 
All day, all night 
Just want to hold you tight

Love 
Your body 
Your beauty 
I want more

KLF

Ladies and gentlemen
KLF has now left the buildingWhere do we go from here?
What must we do to make that change?
It's time to understand, understand one another

In a world so cold a place of disbelief
Where will the people go without enough to eat
Let's not give up hope
We have to find a way
Search within our soul to make a better day

This house is our house
Let's do it for the people
This house is their house
Let's give it back to the people
The people of the world today

I see hurt in their eyes
I hear the sounds of voices cry
It's time to open our eyes
Time to help one another

In a world so cold a place of disbelief
Where can the people go to find a place to sleep
Let's not give up hope we have to find a way
Search within our soul to make a better day

This house is our house
Let's do it for the people
This house is their house
Let's give it back to the people
The people of the world today

You-Me-We can make the difference
And you know no one, no one likes to be alone
We got to face it heart to heart
We have to make a brand new start
We got to change the tears to smiles
We have to go the extra mile

(You-me) It's time we face reality
(We can make the difference)
Give them hope and set them free
I think it's time we say goodbye
To all the homeless people's cry

We've got to take the time to search the mind to find

This house, our house
(It's all in the hands of love)
(I said it's all in the hands of love)

This house is our house
Let's do it for the people
This house is their house
Let's give it back to the people
The people of the world todayPlay that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off 'cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any kid n' play

For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls

Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down

You might have it

So don't be mad and don't be sad
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here, it's not the same
It's not the same

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got
He's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
He won't let go

He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

He fills me up (he fills me up)
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got (he's all I got)
He's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need
 (All the man, all the man I need)

He fills me up (he fills me up)
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I got (he's all I got)
He's all I got in this world
But he's all the man that I need

(He fills me up)
(He's all I got)Open the door and come in
I'm so glad to see you, my friend
Don't know how long it has been
Having those feelings again

And now I see that you're so happy
And ooh, it just sets me free
And I'd like to see us as good of friends
As we used to be

(Aah) my love (aah)

You're in love
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know
That you're not in love with me

Ooh, it's enough for me to know
That you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

Sometimes it's hard to believe
That you're never coming back for me
I've had this dream that you'd always be by my side
Oh, I could have died

But now I see that you're so happy (see that you're so happy)
And ooh, it just sets me free
And I'd like to see us as good of friends
As we used to be

(Aah) ooh, my love (aah)

You're in love (you're in love)
That's the way it should be
'Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love (you're in love)
And I know
That you're not in love with me

Ooh, it's enough for me to know
That you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

I tried to find you but you were so far away
I was praying that fate would bring you back to me
Someday (someday), someday, someday
Ooh, you're in love

Ooh, it's enough for me to know
That you're in love
Now I'll let you go
'Cause I know that you're in love

No, no
No, no
No, no, no, noA simple touch of your hand,
And everything is right.
The gentle way you look at me,
When we kiss goodnight.
You've given me the freedom no other love has known
And now I thank you girl, thank you girl

The countless ways you've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away
A picture perfect painting, that's what our love is
And yes I need you so, and now I know

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

Sometimes I wonder what I'd be
Had I not found you
A lost and lonely soul this world
Could show me nothing new

But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be
And now I see

The two of us together
Through time will never part
This fairy tale we sharing
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise I do make
Heaven is ours to take

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

When I'm lost and insecure
You build me up and make me sure
That everything will turn out right
My love

Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you

(This fairy tale we're sharing
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end)You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Oh, you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been 
And laugh and joke about me on the phone

You can tell my arms, go back onto the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips 
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff, his fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway

Or tell your aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind 
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Ooh

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think it'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Ooh

Whoo!When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you

And you claim that you
Don't care where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why ya callin' all around
Think I've got some dip on the side

Girl you don't trust no one
And you constantly in doubt
You lose the game
If you play that way

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

When you love someone
And you want to love 'em right
Got to get more lovin' about cha

When you know
That you're holdin' on too tight
Soon they will be leavin' without you

Say that you love someone
Why you callin' all my friends
Thinkin' I got somethin' to hide

Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game
If you, if you play that way

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl when you love someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around

And the more I think about it
You'll lose all your clout and
You lose the game baby
If you play that way

Back to the BB Brown

Don't try to step on me wrong or you'll fall slow
'Cause I just want to kick soul to ya
Maybe, baby, take control of ya, just like I told ya

Able to make you move and groove
And leave you like ooh when I touch ya
Give you so much of the feeling of the deck

Yo Stylz kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in our style
So what I've come to do is kick you something fly and new

And creativity add it up together equals the B.B.B. posse
Yeah, we've in the house, yo kick it

Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together and you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' it 'round and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me, you just don't realize
You've never been there before, it's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm going to do)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Spoken:
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you

I'm not out to go out and cheat at night, just like you did baby
But that's alright, (Huh) I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you just come back to me
(Lonely) Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts baby
(Lonely) I feel pain too
Baby please

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Although we've come, to the end of the road  (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no, no no)
It's unnatural (No no no no no no) you belong to me
I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come, (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my god, help me out of this baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Although we've come, to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Alright, alright alright)
It's unnatural (It's unnatural), you belong to me (You belong to me)
I belong to you (I belong to you, whoa)

Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no, no no)
It's unnatural (No no no no no no), you belong to me, I belong to youHow do I say goodbye
To what we had
The good times that made us laugh
Outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterdayMeeting Mister Right, the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love or at least it seems
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me, that gentle lovin' stare

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no, no

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings, can't describe it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings, can't describe it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

It seems so many times he seemed to be the one
But all he ever wanted was to have a little fun
But now you've come along and brightened up my world
In my heart I feel it I'm that special kind of girl

Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no, no

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings, can't describe it

Finally it's happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Finally, oh yeah
Yeaheaheaheah...

Finally, oh yeah
Ah, ah, ah...Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone, I could trust someone

I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you
That I've found my home, that I'm finally home

I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to

No, you're never gonna get it (my sweet loving)
Never ever gonna get it (my sweet loving)Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven?

I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?

I'll find my way
Through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you beggin' please, beggin' please

Beyond the door
There's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you be the same
If I saw you in heaven?

I must be strong
And carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heavenWhen I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darling, when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same, yeah

Nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just trying to kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's letting go today, walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine, all mine

So if you want to love me
Then darling, don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walking
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?

Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So nevermind the darkness
We still can find a way
Nothing lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebodyShe's playin' hard to get
Guess she likes me
She's playin' hard to get
Guess she likes me
She likes me
She's playin', baby

I can tell by the look in her eyes
That she's into me
Cause when she passes by and say "Hi"
I can tell by her smile
That she's shy as can be (she's playin')
I don't think she can see my crush on her
But I can feel her crush on me

She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit, ooh yeah
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playin' hard

I can feel her vibe for me
Even though she hasn't said a word
I bet she's glad I'm readin' her mind
Cause there's so much she wants to say
But she doesn't have the nerve
And all that she doesn't say
I'm sure I see it in her eyes

She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit it
Ooh yeah, she likes me, she likes me
She's playing hard to get

I know she likes me, yeah
She likes me
She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
She's playin'
That she likes me
She likes me

You don't have to say a word (playin' hard)
But I still know how deep the feelings are you have for me
Your smile and the look in your eyes
Says more than any words you could ever say

She's playing hard to get
She's playing
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playing hard to get
She's playing
That she likes me
She likes me

Come on, baby girl
So why are you doing this playing hard to get
I know that you want me
I see it in your eyes
You can't hide it
You're playing hard to get
Playin' hard to get

I don't think she can see my crush on her
But I can feel her crush on me

She's playing hard to get
She just won't admit
She's playin'
That she likes me
She likes me
She's playin hard to get
She just won't admit it (but she won't admit it)
Ooh yeah, she likes me
But she likes me
So hard, admit it
She likes me, she likes me, she likes me
So shy I can tell ???Pack it up, pack it in
Let me begin
I came to win
Battle me, that's a sin

I won't ever slack up
Punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up

Get up, stand up (come on!)
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling
Jump up touch the ceiling

Muggs lifts a funk flow
Someone's talking junk, yo
I'll bust him in the eye
And then I'll take the punk's hoe

Feelin', funkin'
Amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around
Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up, jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump

I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe

Word to your moms
I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms

And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone stepping on me - you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun (shotgun)

But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me - you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around
Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up, jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out as if my name was Sega

But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck get down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn Of The Dead

I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya

I came to get down
I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around
Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump

Yo, this is dedicated
To Joe "De Berg" Dakota
Grab your bozak, punkYou've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies
A lot of people ask the questions why
Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em, Joe)

I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Ah, yeah
Y'all, check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down

There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see
I know there's still a possibility
You raise a little kid, he turns out bold
It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)

I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

(Large) If large is how ya livin'
Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given
To you, in the form of true experience
'Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'

And this is from the J, the O, and the E

Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary
Yo', how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail
Now on the other hand, there's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)Mornings alone
When you come home I breathe a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same (It'd never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away (How can you stay away so long)
Away so long

Why can't we stay together
Give me a reason, give me a reason

'Cause I, I don't want to say it
I don't want to find another way
Make it through the day without you
I - I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
It's just another day, oh

Making the time
(Find the right lines) to make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you
I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Oh, give us a chance to make it, (give us a chance to make it)
To make it
Oh, no no

Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong, I'm not that strong

I - I don't want to say it
I don't want to find another way
Make it through the day without you
I - I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
No

Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason, give me a reason

'Cause I, I don't want to say it
I don't want to find another way (Don't want to find a way)
Make it through the day without you
(I want to make it through the day, no)
I - I can't resist (baby, no)
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
I - I don't want to say it (Don't want to find a way no)
I don't want to find another way
Make it through the day without you
I - I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you

EroticaThis used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

Don't look back, keep your head held high
Don't ask them why, because life is short
And before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

No regrets
But I wish that you were here with me
Well then, there's hope yet
I can see your face in our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy

This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me

This used to be our playground (used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with meCan't let go ooh baby

There you are holding her hand 
I am lost dying to understand 
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know you were my life?

Even though I try I can't let go 
Something in your eyes captured my soul 
And every night I see you in my dreams 
You're all I know I can't let go 

Just cast aside you don't even know I'm alive 
You just walk on by don't care to see me cry  
Here I am still holding on 
I can't accept my world is gone, no, no

Even though I try I can't let go 
Something in your eyes captured my soul 
And every night I see you in my dreams 
You're all I know I can't let go 

Do you even realize the sorrow
I have inside every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny
That I need you but still you remain on my mind 

(Even though I try I can't let go)
No I just can't get you out of my mind
(Something in your eyes captured my soul)
I never can say goodbye 
And every night
(And every night I see you in my dreams)
(You're all I know I can't let go)
You're all I know I can't let you go 

(Even though I try I can't let go) 
Even though I try
(Something in your eyes captured my soul)
I can't let go of something that I need so badly
(And every night I see you in my dreams) 
(You're all I know I can't let go) 

Ooh babyYou and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love

Then I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there, baby
You know I'll be there
Just call my name
And I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder

Just call my name
And I'll be thereNot more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid

No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on

You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I have to keep going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord

If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it happen
(Make it happen)

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
(Make it happen)

And if you get down on your
Knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen

MICHAEL
Ow!
Ow!

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight!
Hee!
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right!
Ooh!
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hee!
Don't compare!
Hee hee!

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sewn when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Sewn, when the goin' gets mean

RAP SINGER
Protection
For gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war
On a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races,
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

MICHAEL
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee hee!
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright, oh
Ooh, ooh
Alright
Yeah yeah yeah, now
Alright, alright
Ooh ooh
Sh'mon, now
Yeah yeah yeah, now
Alright
Ooh ooh

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
Whoo!
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
Whoo!Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end
Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes, we'd stare

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember how we used to talk, ya know
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said 
Like I love you so, I'll never let you go
Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And, girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had, now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Remember the time, remember the time (do you remember girl)
Remember the time (on the phone, you and me), remember the time (till dawn, two or three)
(What about us, girl) remember the time (do you, do you, do you, do you, do you)
Remember the time (In the park, on the beach)
Remember the time, remember the time (you and me in Spain)
(What about, what about) remember the time (Ooh, in the park)
Remember the time (after dark, do you, do you, do you)
Remember the time (do you, do you, do you, do you)
Remember the time (yeah, yeah), remember the timeHold on, little girl
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up, little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad

When it's through, it's through
Fate could twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside, I hope you'll feel it, too (feel it, too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you

Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up, who cares about
Little boys that talk too much

I've seen it all go down
Your game of love was all rained out
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to hold you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one, yeah)
Deep inside, I hope you'll feel it, too (feel it, too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (waited on a line)
Yeah, just to be the next to be with you

Why be alone
When we can be together, baby?
You can make my life worthwhile
I can make you start to smile

When it's through, it's through
Fate could twist the both of you
So come on, baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you

I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside, I hope you'll feel it too (feel it, too)

Deep inside, I hope you'll feel it, too (deep inside, you'll feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (waited on that line)
Yeah, just to be the next to be with you

Just to be the next to be with you, wooSet adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans to a cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing

I think its one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that's trying to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinking about it
I don't know, I doubt it

Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Misses Princess who?

Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire

I can remember when I caught up
With a past-time intimate friend, she said
"Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me."

She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring

An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning

Reality used to be a friend of mine
Caused complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone

She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do
I feel for her, I really do

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of youIs this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro
Magnifico (Oh, oh, oh, oh!)
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No!
We will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go!)
Will not let you go (Let me go!) (Never, never, never, never, never let me go!)
Will not let you go (Let me go!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

Ooh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blowsSometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

And I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah-yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah-yeah
Love me, I said, yeah, yeah

One time

Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away

Yeah, yeah-yeah (away)

I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play

'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile

The clock at work says, "Three"
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

'Cause I love your smile
Hey said, "I love your smile"

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know, I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig

The life that I'm livin'
This is the life that I have
And it's given to you
Yeah and it's true
La-d-da
Twinkley D
Do you?

Believe in a girl
Like me
Shanice is the one
For you to be with
But when I'm caught
All alone
I start fessin'
It's from a state of depression

And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder "do you still love me?
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
Smile

Yes I do boy

I really doOh my God, Becky, look at her butt
It is so big
She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, you know,
Who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute, okay?

I mean her butt
It's just so big
I can't believe it's just so round
It's like out there
I mean, gross
Look, she's just so... black!

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung

Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed?
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes m-m-me so horny

Ooh, rump of smooth skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz
Well use me, use me, 'cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen them dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that

She gotta pack much back, so...
Fellas (yeah), fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell them to shake it (shake it), shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back

(L.A. face with an Oakland booty)
Baby got back
(L.A. face with an Oakland booty)

I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself
I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And uh, double-up, uh, uh

I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble

So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

A word to the thick soul sistas
I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *breathing*
Till the break of dawn

Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on

So ladies (yeah), ladies (yeah)
If you wanna role in my Mercedes? (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
"Baby got back!"

Baby got back
Yeah, baby
When it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection
36-24-36 ha ha
Only if she's 5'3"

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups but please don't lose that butt

Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sister, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

So ladies if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT and kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much backThat old dog has chained you up, all right
Give you everything you need to live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Made sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything, tonight, I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind, and you won't feel ashamed

Open up on the inside
Gonna fill you up, gonna make you cry

This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you come inside my jungle book
Or is it just too good?
Don't say you'll stay, 'cause then you go away

Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Made sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything, tonight, I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind, and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks, for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn, I wish I was your lover (oh, yeah)

If I was your girl, believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better (guess what)
Come, let me in, mm
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through Heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in, oh
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

I sat on a mountainside with peace of mind
And I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Made sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything, tonight, I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind, and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks, for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn, I wish I was your lover

I wanna open up, I'm gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry

Damn, I wish I was your lover
Gettin' on a subway, and I'm comin' uptown

Standing on the street corner, waiting for my love to change

Damn, I wish I was your lover
And I'm feelin' like a school boy, too shy and too young, oh

Damn, I wish I was your lover
I wanna open up, I'm gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry

Damn, I wish I was your lover

Hanging around this jungle, wishing that this love would changeNow you want my love, well that's alright

But you gotta be good, and do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life

Oh baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
'Cause if you gonna get me off
You got to love me deep

Well, you want my heart, and all my time

'Cause a girl like me, won't settle for less
I require plenty conversation with my sex

Long as you know, that I can have any man I want to baby
That's actual and factual, but still I choose you
To be with me, and work on it, so you better not flake it up

I can have any man that I want to
Time and place that I choose to

Time and place that I choose to
But I'm thinkin' that I would rather be here with you yeahI hear her voice in my mind
I know her face by heart
Heaven and earth are moving in my soul
I don't know where to start

Tell me, tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like trying to catch a falling star

At night I dream that she is there
And I can feel her in the air
Tell me, tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like trying to catch a falling star

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like trying to catch a falling star

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like trying to catch a falling star

Yeah
YeahSometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face-to-face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

La la la la la la la
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last
Yeah, yeahIn the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To the river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That is running to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night

(I go walking in the middle of the...)Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
One, two, three, and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man and at the same time burning her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
(Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom)

Dr. Dre:
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)

Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre:
Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So Dre (What up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton

Dr. Dre:
Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg:
Like this, that, this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still, I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'll say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well, now, pride's gone out the window 'cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'll say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

(Just blown away)

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Every world is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world is my world (I will learn to survive)
Any world is my worldSPOKEN INTRO

Sittin' over here
Starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes
Sure don't give a damn and
Ya don't know
That I've been dreamin' of ya in my fantasy

Never once you looked at me,
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you
To fulfill my needs
Think what you want
Let your mind free
Run free to a place that no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed excited over you
I've closed my eyes and thought of us,
A hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times
I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl
Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman,
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, and I won't
But, if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time 'cause we've got all night
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like
If you like, I'll go down
Da down down down da down down
I'll hold you in my hand and baby

You're smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad I can taste your love right now, baby
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl
Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman,
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, and I won't
But, if I was your girl

If I was your girl
Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman,
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, and I won't
But, if I was your girl


Ooh... (Nights I've laid in bed excited over you)
Ooh... (One hundred different ways I've thought of)

Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to

The things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, and I won't
But, if I was your girl

If I was your girl
Oh the things I'll do to you
I'd make you call out my name
I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman,
The things I'd do to you
But I'm not...Like a moth to a flame

Lately, I've had the strangest feeling, oh, yeah
With no vivid reason here to find
But yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
Around my mind
('Round my mind, oh, 'round my mind)
K-Ci, sing it, sing it

(K-Ci)
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
And with you say 'No special place to go'
But when I ask, 'will you be coming back soon'
You don't know, never know, oh...

(JoJo)
I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
Yeah, yeah, baby, well, well

(K-Ci)
'Cause this time could mean good, goodbye

(JoJo)
Bye-bye

Farewell, farewell

(JoJo)
Farewell

(K-Ci)
Oh, why don't you tell me

(JoJo)
Well, well, well
Lately I've been staring in the mirror, oh, yeah
Very slowly picking me apart, oh
Saying I'm trying to tell myself that I have no reason
With your heart, yeah, yeah, yeah

(K-Ci)
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But, when I asked you other thoughts your keeping
You just said 'nothing changed'

(Jojo)
I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

(K-Ci)
Oh, yes you do
'Cause this time could mean good, goodbye, goodbye

(Jojo)
I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel
My eyes won't let me hide

Yes, they do, yes, they do

He took the words right out my mouth and walked a mile in my shoes
I've paid so many dues, I feel used and abused

A figment, of your imagination

I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world
Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

Yeah baby, 'cause inside I'd die without you

With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time after time I try to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In your condition I don't want to be alone

Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like the madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the sameParty people

Peace
And we out(Verse One (Kandi):)
Every man wants a woman,
Where him and her can just go hang.
Just the two of them alone, kick back,
Doing their own thing.
And every man wants a woman,
That can always keep him in the mood.
And I'm that kind of girl,
So this is what I tell my dude.

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.
(Repeat x2)

(Verse Two (Kandi):)
Every man wants a woman,
That can cook him up a good meal.
A woman he can treat like his homie,
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill.
Every man wants a woman,
That ain't good for just laying on her back.
(LaTocha):And I'm that kind of woman,
(Kandi):So before me and my man get in the sack...

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Strictly for the nigga's

She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late in the morninglight
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought:
"Oh, what a morning"

It's not a day for work, ah
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants

All that she wants

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's a hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you
Won't talk forever

It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah



All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheah

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeaheaheah

All that she wants
All that she wantsI will survive without you

Don't tell me that you wanna leave

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine

Just walk out that door
Yeah, see if I care
Go on and go now, but

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight (Holding me tight)
If you ever think about me
Just know that I'll be alright (I'll be alright)

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine

I know I'll survive
Sure I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know

I wish I could scream out loud that I love you
I wish I could say to you: "Don't go"

As he walks away he feels the pain getting strong
People in your life they don't know what's going on
Too proud to turn around
He's gone

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Baby, don't turn around!
Don't turn around

Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Don't turn around!
Don't turn around

Just walk awayI, I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you?

I, why do I bother
When you're not the one for me?
(Ooh)
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
(But where do you belong?)

I, under the pale moon
For so many years I wondered
Who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?

Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
(Ooh)
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
(But where do you belong?)


I saw the sign
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you, oh, oh oh oh

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)

And it opened up my eyes, I saw the signI swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part

'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I made mistakes
I'll never break your heart

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there
I swear like a shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear, ooh

I'll give you every thing I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls

And when (and when) there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

Repeat 1 till endCome on y'all let's take a ride
Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yeah that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin
Ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggaz set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin' in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggaz
I keep on searchin and I keep on lookin'
But niggaz are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggaz can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by
You better be ready so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride you better be ready for the 5 rolls by

Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)
Just roll along (that's what you do)
Just roll along (that's right)

Do you want to ride with me
(Repeat 9 times)Once there was this kid who
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed so hard

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
And when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

But both girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that

'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Ah
Ah

Ah
AhThis song's dedicated to my homies
In that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon

It seems like yesterday
We were hanging round the hood
Now I'm gonna keep your memories alive
Like a homie should

A life time of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep stepping
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my forty to your memory
Take a drink and I start to think
And I, I know one day soon we'll be
We'll be hanging out

This is for my homies
(This is for my homies, well, well)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

This is for my homies
(This is for my homies, well)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

My God, my God
Would you pass on a message for me
Ha, tell him, put down those
Dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie

Could you tell him
I'll never let go of his memory
So his son will know
You don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back
I said God's got his back

A lifetime of memories
(Lifetime of memories)
Going down the drain
(Going down the drain)

I'd like to keep stepping
(I would, oh, no)
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my forty to your memory
Take a drink and I start to think
And I, I know one day soon we'll be
We'll be hanging out

This is for my homies
(This is for my homies)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

This is for my homies
(You know I miss you)
(You know I miss you, my homies)
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean
In that gangsta lean

This song is dedicated to my homies
In that gangsta lean
Tommy from Master's Touch
My boy, EB and my boy, Ebeer

And whoever else out there that
Got a homie that's in a gangsta lean
And also, my boys in the pen
That ain't never gonna see the street again

Cause you know what
It don't matter what they was
Doing while they was here
They coulda been banging, slanging
But they ain't here no more

Now somebody's dead
Somebody's baby
That's somebody's homie
So go on and let 'em rest in peace
While they in that gansta lean
You know what I'm saying
That's on the real low

This is for my homies
(I can't believe that you're gone)
See you when I get there
(I'll see you, I'll see you)
(I'll see you)

This is for my homies
(Now that you're in that gangsta lean)
(Well, well, well, well)
See you when I get there
(I'm so sorry you're gone
But I've got to keep on)

This is for my homies
(I gotta keep on)
(I gotta keep moving)
(Moving, moving, moving)

See you when I get there
(I'll see you, I'll see you
One day, someday...Love - Devotion
Feeling - Emotion

Don't be afraid to be weak
Don't be too proud to be strong
Just look into your heart my friend
That will be the return to yourself
The return to innocence

If you want, then start to laugh
If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself don't hide
Just believe in destiny

Don't care what people say
Just follow your own way
Don't give up and use the chance
To return to innocence

That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence

That's the return to innocenceFriends come a dime a dozen, Ooh
But I know that I will never find a friend like you, Ooh

I will never lie again (I will never lie)
Cause a friend like you, will last forever

All the fun things we used to do
I feel the pain, please come back to me
Cause a friend like you will only, come once in a lifetime

I will never lie again (I will never lie again)
'Cause you'll always be my friend (you'll always be my friend)
I will never lie again (I will never I will never lie)

Cause a friend like you (a friend like you) will last forever (will last forever)I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you againMy love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
Oh yeah

My first love (yeah)
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

(Oh)
And I (And I)
I want to share
All my love with you, hey yeah
No one else will do
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes
You will always be
My endless love
Oh yeah

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever (forever)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
No no no no (no no no)

And I
(And I)
I'd be a fool
For you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind (no, you know I don't mind)
'Cause baby you (baby, baby, baby, baby)
You mean the world to me, yeah
I know I've found in you
My endless love

Yeah (yeah)
Do do, do dooo, do do do

Whoa
And I
I'd play the fool
For you, (for you baby) I'm sure
That you know I don't mind (you know I don't mind)
Oh, yes
You'd be the only one
'Cause no one can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love (my love, my love)
My my my
My endless love

My loveSay goodbye to not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say goodbye to not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

And I'll remember the strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you saved me
I'll remember

Inside I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me
I'll remember

I learned to let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned to let go, I travel in stillness
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember (I'll remember)
(I'll remember) mmmmm

And I'll remember the love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember the way that you changed me
I'll remember
(I'll remember)

No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)

No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)

No, I've never been afraid to cry
And I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your (shared your)
Secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret (a secret)

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood

You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your (shared your)
Secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret (a secret)

Mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret (a secret)

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm

My baby's got a secret (secret)

My baby's got a secret (secret)

Mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm mmm, my baby's got a secret for me

Mmm mmm, mmm mmm, mmm mmmThere's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Oh oh

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in youAnd I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way
You feel right now, oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that, ah
No, I won't do that

And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing
I've ever seen before or will again

And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself
If we don't go all the way tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God of
Sex and drums and rock 'n' roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I'm watching you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
And I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

But I'll never stop dreaming of you
Every night of my life, no way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Will you raise me up? Will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this god forsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

I can do that
Oh, I can do that

Will you hold me sacred? Will you hold me tight?
Can you colorize my life? I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?

I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot, ha?
Will you take me places I've never known?

Now, I can do that
Oh woah now, I can do that

After awhile you'll forget everything
It was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
And you'll see that it's time to move on

I won't do that
I won't do that

I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around

I won't do that
No, I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do thatCould you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say I hope you are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy 'cause after you all one can do is die, oh

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower? Oh
I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh yes, oh

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside

Could you be (could you be) the most beautiful girl in the world?
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain to see (plain to see) you're the reason that God made a girl

Oh yeah! (Oh, yes you are)
Girl (Could you be?)
You must be ... oh yeah!
(Could you be?)
You're the reason... oh yeah
(Could)My mind's telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you

To satisfy your every need

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac shit
But every time they tried I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good manHit it

This ain't no disco
And it ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me outta nowhere

It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life

And we are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash

And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars
On their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing
As best they can
In skirts and suits

They drive their
Shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company
The record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

And he shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match
In an over-sized pack
Letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise, the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica BoulevardIf I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again
If I never hear "I love you" now and then
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand... if love ends
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinking about
About the love that you made to me
And I can't get you out of my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away?
And I can't stop caring about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doing without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again

And I can't stop thinking about
About the way my life would be
No, I can't stop thinking about
How could you love me then leave?
And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I've tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doing without
Without the wailing of my heart
No, I can't stop doing without
For I would surely fall apart
And I can't get you out of my mind
And I know I can't deny it
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me againRegulators
We regulate any stealing of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep!
Regulators! Mount up!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3

So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said "What's up?"
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said "I'm stuck."

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't 'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said "Damn, what's next?"

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glance in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin'
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G.

Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G. Child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "Ooh, I like your size"
She said "My car's broke down and you sing real nice,
Would ya let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking
Into a whole new era
G-Funk
Step to this, I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
2-1-3 will regulate
