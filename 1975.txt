I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

Be quiet, big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

I keep your picture upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

I'm not in love, no, no
(It's because)

Oooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Oooh, you'll wait a long time
Oooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Oooh, you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love
I'm not in love!How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Well, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

And you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

How long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?

Oh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem

Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us any day

And how long has this been going on?
How long has this been going on?
How long
How long has this been going on?
How long has this
How long has this been going on?
How long
How long has this been going on?

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you
Drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway in the sky

This is for all the single people
Thinking that love has left them dry
Don't give up until you
Drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home
Hit it

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you
Drink from the silver cup
She'll never take you down or
Never give you up
You'll never know until you try

Well I tried to make it Sunday
But I got so damned depressed
That I set my sights on Monday
And I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar
But I do agree there's times
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

Well I keep on thinking 'bout you 
Sister golden hair surprise
And I just can't live without you
Can't you see it in my eyes
I've been one poor correspondent
And I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle 
Will you meet me in the air
Will you love me just a little
Just enough to show you care
Well I tried to fake it
I don't mind saying
I just can't make it

Well I keep on thinking 'bout you 
Sister golden hair surprise
And I just can't live without you
Can't you see it in my eyes
Now I've been one poor correspondent
And I've been too, too hard to find
But it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind

Will you meet me in the middle
Will you meet me in the air
Will you love me just a little
Just enough to show you care
Well I tried to fake it
I don't mind saying
I just can't make itIt's lonely out tonight
And the feeling just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

So please, play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

So please, play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

Hey, won't you play another
Somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home
While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby

Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time

Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing

But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Stop, I've been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

Just stop 'cause I really love you

Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever

Young and beautiful
But someday your looks'll be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turning you on

I will be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before and I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need ya now and I need ya then

Just stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever
I will, I will, I will, I will

You better stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever
I will, I will, I will, I will
(Da da da da, da da da da, da da da da)
(Sedaka is back)
(Da da da da, da da da da, da da da da)I never wanted
I never wanted to touch a man
The way that I want to touch you

I never wanted
I never wanted to love a man
The way that I want to love you

You are sunshine
You are shadow
You are morning
You are night
You are hard times
You are good times
You are darkness
You are light

I never wanted
I never wanted to give a man
The things that I want to give you

I never wanted
I never wanted to live with a man
The way that I want to live with you

You are sunshine
You are shadow

The way that I want to touch you

After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do

Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filing the world surrounding me

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave
The past and all its tears behind me(Stop!) 

Oh yes, wait a minute, mister Postman
(Wait!) Wait, Mister Postman

(Please, mister Postman, look and see) 
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me) 
Please, please, mister Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time?) 
Oh yeah
(For me to hear from that boy of mine)

There must be some word today
From my boyfriend, so far away
Please, mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me

I've been standin' here waitin', mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Sayin' he's returning' home to me

Mister Postman 
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yeah
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, mister Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time?)
Oh yeah

So many days you passed me by
See the tears standin' in my eyes
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter

Mister Postman
(Mister Postman, look and see)
Oh yea
(If there's a letter in your bag for me)
Please, please, mister Postman
(Why's it takin' such a long time?)
Why don't you check it and see one more time for me?

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh mister Postman
(Mister Postman, look and see)

Come on, deliver the letter, the sooner, the better

(Mister Postman)Old days
Good times I remember
Fun days
Filled with simple pleasure

Drive-in movies
Comic books and blue jeans
Howdy Doody
Baseball cards and birthdays

Take me back
To a world gone away
Memories
Seem like yesterday

Oh, old days
Good times I remember
Gold days
Days I'll always treasure

Funny faces
Full of love and laughter
Funny places
Summer nights and streetcars

Take me back
To a world gone away
Boyhood memories
Seem like yesterday

Old days
On my mind and in my heart to stay
Old days
Darkened dreams of good times gone away
Old days
Days of love and feeling fancy-free
Old days
Days of magic still so close to me

Old days
On my mind and in my heart to stay
Old days
Darkened dreams of good times gone away
Old days
Days of love and feeling fancy-free
Old days
Days of magic still so close to me

Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame

Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame

(Could it be the best, could it be?)
(Really be, really, babe?)
(Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?)
(Could it, babe? Could it, babe?)

Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool?
Fame

Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a raincheck on pain
Fame

Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame

Fame
What's your name?

(Get me some, fame)
(Now get-ah, fame)Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Every night, the same old dream
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry

She called me up, late that night
She said, "Joe, don't come over,
But Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door!

I've never seen him act this way,
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done, he's got a gun!
So run, Joey run, Joey run!"

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Got in my car, and I drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me, with tear-filled eyes
And bruises on her face!

All at once I saw him there,
Sneaking up behind me (Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, "He's got a gun!"
And she stepped in front of me

Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling!
I ran to her, I held her close
When I looked down, my hands were red
And here's the last words Julie said...

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married

Run, Joey run, Joey run, Joey run
Joey run, Joey run, Joey run!Every night I'm lyin' in bed
Holdin' you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams

We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give

That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (you get the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (you get the best of my love)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping

But every mornin', I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way and I see it mine
But we both see it slippin' away

You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love

Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)

Oh sweet darlin', every night and day
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)
Oh sweet darlin'
You get the best of my love (the best of my love)

City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man, and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes

One of these nights 
One of these crazy old nights 
We're gonna find out, pretty mama 
What turns on your lights

The full moon is calling 
The fever is high 
And the wicked wind whispers and moans 
You got your demons 
You got desires 
Well, I got a few of my own 

Ooh, someone to be kind to 
In between the dark and the light 
Ooh, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights 

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams
We're gonna find one
One that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter 
Of the devil himself 
I've been searching for an angel in white 
I've been waiting for a woman
Who's a little of both 
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight 

Ooh, loneliness will blind you 
In between the wrong and the right 
Ooh, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights 

One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you
Get you baby one of these nights 

One of these nights
Hoo, hoo
One of these nights
I can feel it, I can feel it

One of these nights 
Coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you now 
One of these nights

One of these nights
One of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights
One of these nights
Swear I'm gonna find you 
Coming right behind you

One of these nights
Hoo, hoo
One of these nightsI see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey so sweet
Down where Lexington crossed 47th Street
Oh, she's a big girl, she's standing six foot three
Turning tricks for the dudes in the big city

Island girl, what you wanted with your white man's world
Island girl, black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanted with the white man's world

Well she's black as coal but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake, oh
He one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake

Island girl, what you wanted with your white man's world
Island girl, black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanted with the white man's world

Island girl, what you wanted with your white man's world
Island girl, black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from the racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wanted with the white man
Tell me what you wanted with the white man
Tell me what you wanted with your white man

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Oh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Oh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Hey, oh, Lucy)
Oh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Oh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Hey, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Hey, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Hey, oh, Lucy)

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima donna, Lord, you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
"You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye"

I never realized the passing hours of evening showers
A slip noose hanging, in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it, listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
"You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye"

And I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds, paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear, sugar bear)
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
"You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye"

Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonight

(Someone saved my life tonight)
Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my life tonightMy eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far away

Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

Walking home every day
Over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce about the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember
How warm and tender
We were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend

'My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored you
So close, so close and yet so far

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored youIf he brings you happiness
Then I wish you all the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

Si te quiere de verdad
Y te da felicidad
Te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos
Pero si te hace llorar
A mi me puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando triste estas

I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To drive away every teardrop that you cried

And if he ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks
Of Broadway

Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I don't really mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train
That's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon 
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
Like a rhinestone cowboyI'm in love with the girl that I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time
To be in love
To be in love

Well, let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about it
There's too many others that know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without it

I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love

All the stories coming back to me
From my friends and the people I don't want to see
The things they say I know just couldn't be true
At least not until I hear it from you

'Cause I still love the little girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearin' it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love

You know that I love the little girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like I'm wearin' it out
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in loveI don't need a whole lots of money
I don't need a big fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for
And I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got me a sweet, a sweet loving woman
And she know just how to treat me right

Oh, my baby, she's alright
Oh, my baby's clean out of sight
Don't you know that she's?
She's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful
Yes, she is, she is
She's some kind of wonderful
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I hold her in my arms
You know she sets my soul on fire
Oh, when my baby kisses me
My heart becomes filled with desire
When she wraps her loving arms around me
It 'bout drives me out of my mind
Yeah, when my baby kisses me
Chills run up and down my spine

Oh, my baby, she's alright
Oh, my baby's clean out of sight
Don't you know that she is?
She's some kind of wonderful
She's some kind of wonderful
Yes, she is

Got a sweet little woman like mine?

Got a, got a sweet little woman like mine

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
There you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) just to thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop (stop) so I could thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) to thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

How sweet it is...

And it feels just about right

Oh...

Just to be loved
Just to be loved by you, baby, yeah

I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, "Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve"
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeenIf only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I 
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I

I might have to move heaven and earth
To prove it to you, baby (Baby)
So we're makin' love
And you feel the power
And I feel the power
Then there's really nothing we can't do
(You know  we could, you know we could)
If we wanted to, baby
(You know we could, you know we could)
We could exist on the stars 
It'd be so easy

Now, baby
All we gotta do (Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby)
Is get a little faith in you (Baby, baby)
Oh, I've been so many places
I've seen some things (Yes, I have)
I know love is the answer (Yes, it is)
Keeps holding this world together, yeah
Ain't nothing better 
Ain't nothing better (Nothing's better)
And all the answers to our prayers
Hell, it's the same everywheres, baby (Just the same now)
Nothing ever breaks up the heart (Love's a game now)
Only tears give you away (Ain't it a shame now?)

Then you're right where I found ya (Oh, baby)
With my arms around ya (Oh, baby)
O-o-o-o-o-o-oh, baby
Baby, baby
Love is a magic word, ooh, yeah (Baby)
Few ever find in a lifetime
But from that very first look in your eyes
I knew you and I had but one heart (Baby)
Only our bodies were apart (It's making me crazy)
That was so easy (Baby)
So easy (Oh, baby)
I had a taste of the real world (Didn't waste a drop of it)
When I went down on you, girl

Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby  (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I 
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I

I can hear windmills and rainbows
Whenever you're talkin' to me (Never say never)
I feel like swirling and dancin'
Whenever you're walking with me (Whenever you're walking with me)
You ripple like a river when I touch you (Let me touch you)
When I pluck your body like a string (Show you what I mean)
When I start dancin' inside ya (Oh, baby)
You make me wanna sing (I love you so)
Yeah (I love you so)
Baby (I love you so)
Baby (I love you so)
Baby (I love you so)
Baby (Oh)

Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
All right (All right) 
Baby, we're sure doin' it tonight (Baby, we're sure doin' it)
Every time you come by, let me try (Come on by)
Pretty please with sugar on it
That's how I like it, ooh
I can't even believe it with you 
It's like having every dream I ever wanted come true (Dream of a lifetime)
I picked up your vibes 
You know, it opened my mind (I'm having a fine time)
But I'm still dreamin', yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh)
And you're right where I found ya (Oh, baby)
With my arms around ya (Oh, baby)

Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby  (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I 
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I
So would I
So would I

Oh, if only you believe like I believe, baby  (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would I 
If only you believe like I believe, baby (If only you believe like I believe)
We'd get by 
If only you believe in miracles, baby (If only you believe in miracles)
So would II'm not Lisa, my name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue, but mine won't leave you
Till the sunlight has touched your face

She was your morning light
Her smile told of no night
Your love for her grew
With each rising sun

And then one winter day
His hand led hers away
She left you here drowning in your tears
Here where you've stayed for years
Crying Lisa, Lisa

I'm not Lisa, my name is Julie
Lisa left you years ago
My eyes are not blue, but mine won't leave you
Till the sunlight shines through your face
I'm not LisaBlown 'round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin

I gave you love, I thought that we 
Had made it to the top
I gave you all I had to give
Why did it have to stop?

You've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high

You, you've blown it all sky high
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high

Up, 'round, I've flown
Then down, down like a stone

I gave you love, I thought that we 
Had made it to the top
I gave you all I had to give
Why did it have to stop?

You've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky high

You, you've blown it all sky high
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high

You, you've blown it all sky high
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why
You've blown it all sky highIt's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost everyday
Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again

I'm sorry for the way things are in China
I'm sorry things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me

Our friends all ask about you
I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear from you almost anytime
But they all know I'm crying
And I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

I'm sorry for all the lies I told you
I'm sorry for the things I didn't say
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
I can't believe you went away

I'm sorry if I took some things for granted
I'm sorry for the chains I put on you
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
For living without you

It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost everyday

Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, the simple kind of life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy

I'd play "Sally Goodin" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't think it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, wooh

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy

Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin' "thatsa mighty keen!"
Well son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride,
Thank God you're a country boy"

Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Wooh, thank God I'm a country boy, yesBaby, baby, let's get together

He met Marmalade down in old New Orleans
Struttin' her stuff on the street
She said, 'ey 'ello, hey Joe, you wanna give it a go? mm, mm?

Guiche Cuiche ya ya da da
Guiche Guiche ya ya here
Mocha chocalata ya ya
Creole Lady Marmalade

Voulez vous coucher avec moi, ce soir
Voulez vous coucher avec moi

Sat in her boudoir while she freshened up
That boy drank all that magnolia wine
On the black satin sheets where he started to freak

Guiche Cuiche ya ya da da
Guiche Guiche ya ya here
Mocha chocalata ya ya
Creole Lady Marmalade

Voulez vous coucher avec moi, ce soir
Voulez vous coucher avec moi

Hey, hey, Hey!

Feel her skin, feelin' silky smooth
Color of cafe au lait
Made the savage beast inside roar until he cried:
More, more, more

Now he's back home doin' 9 to 5
Livin' his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep, old memories keep
More, more, more

Guiche Cuiche ya ya da da
Guiche Guiche ya ya here
Mocha chocalata ya ya
Creole Lady Marmalade

Voulez vous coucher avec moi, ce soir
Voulez vous coucher avec moi

Guiche Guiche ya ya da da da daI've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?

I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?

Feeling better, now that we're through
Feeling better 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good


I'm telling you now, baby
And I'm going my way
Forget about you, baby
'Cause I'm leaving this day

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
Oh, oh no

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no goodThe time is right
You hold me tight
And love is got me high

Please tell me, yes
And don't say no, honey not tonight
I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
Till I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
'Cause love won't let me wait
(Not one more minute, baby)

The time is right
Turned down the lights and take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night in a wonderland
Now move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly
Take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait

(No, listen girl)

I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstacy
And I won't take the blame
'Cause love won't let me wait, no
Love won't let me wait (my temperature's rising)
Love won't let me wait (cause your so tantalizing)

(Oh, listen girl)

Love won't let me wait

She comes down from Yellow Mountain
On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down its stall
In a blizard he was lost

She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire

By the dark of the moon - I planted
But there came an early snow
There's been a hoot-owl howling by my window now
For six nights in a row
She's coming for me I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go 

We'll be riding Wildfire
We'll be riding Wildfire
We'll be riding Wildfire

On Wildfire we're gonna ride
Gonna leave sodbustin' behind
Get these hard times right on out of our minds
Riding Wildfire

Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful
Makin' love with you is all I wanna do
Lovin' you is more than just a dream come true
And everything that I do is out of lovin' you

La-la la-la-la

La-la la-la-la la-la la la la
Doo'n doo'n doo-doo, ahh

No one else can make me feel
The colors that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in springtime

'Cause lovin' you has made my life so beautiful
And every day of my life is filled with lovin' you
Lovin' you, I see your soul come shinin' through

But it was you
Who went and bit off 
A little bit more than he could chew

You said that you had it made
But you been had
The woman no good, no how
Thinkin' maybe the blood is bad

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The woman was born to lie
Makes promises she can't keep
With the wink of an eye

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Brother, you've been deceived
It's bound to change your mind
About all you believe

From where I stand
It looks mighty strange
How you let a woman like that
Treat you like small change

I don't understand
What you're lookin' to find
The only thing bad blood do
Is mess up a good man's mind
Hear me talkin' now

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
The bitch is in her smile
The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

The lie is on her lips
Such an evil child

Bad (bad) blood (blood)
Is takin' you for a ride
The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slide

The only thing good about bad blood
Is lettin' it slideStrolling along country roads with my baby
It starts to rain, it begins to pour
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

After awhile we run under a tree (after awhile)
I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat)
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel insideHey, ha, uh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, Lord (ow, gow)
Hey, ha, uh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, Lord
(Fire)

Fire (Uh, uh)
Fire (Sing us home) (Oh Lord)
Fire (woo, woo, woo, woo)
Fire

The way you walk and talk really sets me off
To a four-alarm, child, yes it does, uh, uh
The way you squeeze and tease knocks to me my knees
'Cause you're smokin', baby, baby

The way you swerve and curve really wracks my nerves
And I'm so excited, child (yeah) woo, woo
The way you push, push lets me know that you're 
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, good
(You're gonna get your wish) Oh, Lord, oh

Fire (what I say, child, ow)
Fire (uh-huh)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (woo)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (no no)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (whoa)

Woo hoo hoo hoo, baby
Says burnin, burnin' baby
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Burnin, burnin' baby
Oh, baby
'Cause someone on me

When you shake what you got, and girl, you've got a lot
You really somethin', child, yes, you are
'Cause when you're hot, you're hot, you really shoot your shot
You're dyn-o-mite child, yeah

Well, I can tell by your game, you're gonna start a flame
In my heart, baby, baby
I'm 'bout to choke from the smoke, got to tighten up my stroke
Can you feel it, girl? Yeah

Got me burnin', got me burnin'
Got me burnin', got me burnin'
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)
Got me burnin', got me burnin' (fire)There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day when I just had to tell my point of view
I was like you

Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back, kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you

Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox 
With the best of country music, old and new 
You can hear your five selections for a quarter 
And somebody else's songs when yours are through 

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter 
And my friends around to help me ease the pain 
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song 
And here I am just missing you again 

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again 

If I had a dime for every time I held you 
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me 
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville 
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee 

But I guess I'd better get myself together 
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind 
Just a note that said "I'm sorry" by your picture 
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind 

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Hides her smile when she's wearing a frown
Ooh, Jackie, you're not so down

You like your life in a freeform style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
What's a game, girl, if you never lose?
Ask a winner, and you'll probably find
Ooh, Jackie, they've lost at some time

Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy, just a natural thing
Like playing music, but you never sing

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places where you've never been
Ooh, Jackie, you're going again

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like sifting through sand
Ooh, Jackie, it slips through your hand

Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sunset but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had

Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Hey, hey, hey, heyYou make me laugh
'Cause your eyes they light the night
They look right through me
You bashful boy
You're hiding something sweet
Please give it to me yeah, to me 

Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all rhyme 

You are a genie
All I ask for is your smile
Each time I rub the lamp
When I am with you
I have a giggling teen-age crush
Then I'm a sultry vamp 

Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all right 

So once again
It's time to say so long
And so recall the cull of life
You're going home now
Home's that place somewhere you go each day
To see your wife 

Talk to me some more
You don't have to go
You're the Poetry Man
You make things all rhymeOh, ho, ho, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
Lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

Oh, ho, ho, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

I love a sunny day
Dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
Never been awake
Never seen a day break
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

Oh, ho, ho, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so

Oh, ho, ho, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not soI gave a girl a ride in my wagon
She crawled in and took control
She was tired as her mind was draggin'
I said get some sleep and dream of rock and roll

'Cause like a picture she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

Her young face was like that of an angel
Her long legs were tanned and brown
Better keep your eyes on the road, son
Better slow this vehicle down

'Cause like a picture she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

I put her out in a town that was so small
You could throw a rock from end to end
A dirt road main street, she walked off in bare feet
It's a shame I won't be passin' through again

'Cause like a picture she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand 
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

'Cause like a picture she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand 
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

'Cause like a picture she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand 
We made love in my Chevy vanI like to see you boogie

Oh, it's been getting so hard
Livin' with the things you do to me, ah-ha
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see, mm

Oh, I see a man at the back as a matter of fact
His eyes are red as the sun
And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one

Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the man at the back said: "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said: "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

Oh, I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do
Oh, I softly call you over
When you appear, there's nothing left of you, ah-ha

Now the man at the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye

Oh yeah, it was electric
So frantically hectic
And the band started leaving
'Cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And the man at the back said: "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said: "Boy, I wanna warn ya"
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Smile is in the makin', we got to fight the powers that be
Got so many voices, saying all the same, yeah,
Killing up all around me, faces full of pain

I tried to play my music, they say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, hey

Time is truly wastin', there's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin', we got to fight the powers that be
I don't understand it, people wanna say yeah

Those that got the answers, red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy, let's just have some fun naw, naw
Seekin' my satisfaction, keeps me on the run

I tried to play my music, say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, ooh

Time is truly wastin', there's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin', we got to fight the powers that be
Fight it baby, yeah, woo, hey, even you and I can fight the power
Fight it, fight the powerCan't get no rest
Don't know how I work all day
When will I learn?
Memories get in the way

I walk around
I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud, but I
Don't see at all
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
Know where to go
It's hopeless, so
I guess I'll leave it alone 

Well, I spent all the day
Fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late
And I found she wasn't there

I guess I'll find
The love, peace of mind, some other time, but I
Still have today
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't
Know where to go
It's hopeless, so
I guess I'll leave it alone

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feelin' blue

Been down too long
Right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spending all day
Thinking just of you

12:45
Headed for the subway home
I took my time
'Cause I felt so all alone

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around, and I
Could see her face
Smilin' as she came, callin' out my name, so I
Know where to go
We'll take it slow
I guess I'll call it a day

Games people play
Night or day, they're just not matching
What they should do
Keeps me feeling blue

'Cause if he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart

Faretheewell, I know you're leavin' (I know you're leavin')
For the new love that you've found
The handsome guy that you've been dating, whoa
I got a feelin' he's gonna put you down 'cause

'Cause he don't love you like I love you
'Cause if he did, he wouldn't break your heart
He don't love you like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart

He uses all the great quotations
Says the things I wish I could say
Whoa, but he's has so many rehearsals, girl
To him it's just another play, but wait

When the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Girl, I'll be there to take you home

He don't love you (and he never will) like I love you
'Cause if he did, he wouldn't break your heart
Oh, he don't love you, girl, like I love you
He's tryin' to tear us apart

He don't love you (and he never will) like I love you"Alright, O.K., ha ha ha ha, very good to see you down in New Orleans man, yeah, yeah really, yeah, yeah"

Any time any day
You can hear the people say
That love is blind
Well I don't know but I say love is kind

Soldier boy kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he won't mind
He's in love and he says love is fine

Oh yes indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know our love will grow
That's what the man said
So won't you listen to what the man said
He said

Ahh take it away

Oh yes indeed we know
That people will find a way to go
No matter what the man said
And love is fine for all we know
For all we know our love will grow

And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free

She moved in like a friend, started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up 
I was here and she was gone 
Now I'm hanging on 
Maybe you can tell me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong

Where did she go when I need her close to me 
And the perfect story ended at the start 
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on, on the chance that you'll come back to me

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling 

I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment 
Maybe half the things we sought were never there 
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size 
It isn't really fair 

How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling 
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darling 
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong, oh my darlingMy baby moves at midnight

My woman take me higher
My woman keep me warm

What you doin' on your back? Ahh
What you doin' on your back? Ahh
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman give me power

And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love light shines
All around us

So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go stealing through the moonlit nights
With your lover

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love rites shine
All around us

So let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season

Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow...Baby's into running around
Hanging with the crowd
Putting your business in the street
Talking out loud

You're saying you bought her this and that
And how much you done spent
I swear she must believe
It's all heaven sent

Hey boy, you better bring the chick around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Taught her how to talk like that
(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Gave her that big idea

Nothing you can't handle
Nothing you ain't got
Put your money on the table
And drive it off the lot

Turn on that old love light
Turn a maybe to a yes
Same old schoolboy game
Got you into this mess

Hey son, you better get on back to town
Face the sad old truth, the dirty lowdown

(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Put those ideas in your head
(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

Yeah

Come on back down to earth, son
Dig the low, low, low, low, lowdown

You ain't got to be so bad
Got to be so cold
This dog eat dog existence
Sure is getting old

Got to have a Jones for this
Jones for that
This running with the Joneses, boy
Just ain't where it's at, huh-uh

You gonna come back around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Got you thinking like that, boy
(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Said I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Oh, look out for that lowdown
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
That dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty lowdown

(Ooh-ooh) I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Got you thinking like that
Got you thinking like

(Ooh-ooh, I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
Look at that girl in the face

I'm ashamed of you
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder whoAh, breaker one-nine, this here's the Rubber Duck. You gotta copy on me, Pig Pen, c'mon? Ah, yeah, 10-4, Pig Pen, fer shure, fer shure. By golly, it's clean clear to Flag Town, c'mon. Yeah, that's a big 10-4 there, Pig Pen, yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy. Mercy sakes alive, looks like we got us a convoy... 

Was the dark of the moon on the sixth of June
In a Kenworth pullin' logs
Cab-over Pete with a reefer on
And a Jimmy haulin' hogs

We is headin' for bear on I-10
'Bout a mile outta Shaky Town
I says, "Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck."
"And I'm about to put the hammer down."

'Cause we got a little convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a little convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight?

Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the USA, convoy

Ah, breaker, Pig Pen, this here's the Duck. And, you wanna back off them hogs? Yeah, 10-4, 'bout five mile or so. Ten, roger. Them hogs is gettin' in-tense up here. 

By the time we got into Tulsa Town
We had eighty-five trucks in all
But they's a roadblock up on the cloverleaf
And them bears was wall-to-wall

Yeah, them smokies is thick as bugs on a bumper
They even had a bear in the air
I says, "Callin' all trucks, this here's the Duck.
We about to go a-huntin' bear."

'Cause we got a great big convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a great big convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight?

Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the USA, convoy

Ah, you wanna give me a 10-9 on that, Pig Pen? Negatory, Pig Pen; you're still too close. Yeah, them hogs is startin' to close up my sinuses. Mercy sakes, you better back off another ten. 

Well, we rolled up Interstate 44
Like a rocket sled on rails
We tore up all of our swindle sheets
And left 'em settin' on the scales

By the time we hit that Chi-town
Them bears was a-gettin' smart
They'd brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard

There's armored cars and tanks and jeeps
And rigs of ev'ry size
Yeah, them chicken coops was full'a bears
And choppers filled the skies

Well, we shot the line and we went for broke
With a thousand screamin' trucks
An' eleven long-haired Friends a' Jesus
In a chartreuse micra-bus

Ah, Rubber Duck to Sodbuster, come over. Yeah, 10-4, Sodbuster? Lissen, you wanna put that micra-bus right behind that suicide jockey? Yeah, he's haulin' dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get. 

Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey shore
And prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a dog-goned dime

I says, "Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck.
We just ain't a-gonna pay no toll."
So we crashed the gate doing ninety-eight
I says "Let them truckers roll, 10-4."

'Cause we got a mighty convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a mighty convoy
Ain't she a beautiful sight?

Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the USA

Convoy! Ah, 10-4, Pig Pen, what's your twenty? 
Convoy! Omaha? Well, they oughta know what to do with them hogs out there fer shure. Well, mercy 
Convoy! sakes, good buddy, we gonna back on outta here, so keep the bugs off your glass and the bears off your...  
Convoy! tail. We'll catch you on the flip-flop. This here's the Rubber Duck on the side. 
Convoy! We gone. 'Bye,'bye.Lonely night, I cry myself to sleep
Tell me, what am I gonna do

 'Cause it's always been you to dry my tears
It's always been you to wash away my fears
It's always been you each night and day
Now what can I say when love slips away?

Lonely night, I'm walking the floor
Tell me, what am I gonna do

Without your precious love, your tender touch
Hey, Little Girl, I miss you so much
Wish we could turn back the hands of time
To the day when you were mine 

You used to call me Angel Face
Used to call me Angel Face
You used to help me through the night
Make me feel all right
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night

 I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind

I promise you I'll change my ways
I promise you love's here to stay
Hey, Little Girl, depend on me
 I'll be yours for eternity

You used to call me Angel Face 
Used to call me Angel Face 
You used to help me through the night 
Make me feel all right 
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night

You used to call me Angel Face 
Used to call me Angel Face 
You used to help me through the night 
Make me feel all right 
Now all I have is teardrops through a lonely night

I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mind
I can't get ya out of my mindMuskrat, muskrat, candle light
Doing the town and doing it right in the evening
It's pretty pleasing
Muskrat Suzie, muskrat Sam
Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land
And they shimmy, Sam is so skinny
And they whirl and they twirl and they tango
Singing and jinging a jangle
Float like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love

Nibbling on bacon
Chewing on cheese
Sam says to Suzie
"Honey, would you please be my Mrs?"
Suzie says yes with her kisses
Now he's tickling her fancy
Rubbing her toes
Muzzle to muzzle
Now anything goes as they wriggle
Sue starts to giggle
And they whirl and they twirl and they tango
Singing and jinging a jangle
Float like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love

And they whirl and they twirl and they tango
Singing and jinging a jangle
Float like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat loveJust because you've become a young woman now
There's still some things that you don't understand now
Before you ask some guy for his hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now
My mama told me
You better shop around

There's some things that I want you to know now
Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The men'll come and the men are gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me
You better shop around

Try to get yourself a bargain, girl
Don't be sold on the very first one
Good-looking guys come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

Before you take a man and say I do now
Make sure he's in love with you now
Make sure that his love is true now
I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now
My mama told me
You better shop aroundIf you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
No, baby please don't go
And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
No, baby please don't go
Girl, I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
No, baby please don't go
Girl, I just got to have you by my side
No, baby please don't go
Mama, I just got to have your loving hereShow me a river that's so deep
Show me a mountain so high
I'll show you love that'll last forever
Flying high, so high

Ah, show me a place where dreams are for dreamers
And all the things you wish come true, yeah
I'd wish the world had all happy people
Then there'd be no more wishing to do

Sweet love

Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Sweet, sweet love

Sun shines over the rainbow
High on a hill
Take a ride on a magic carpet
And you know it's for real

The world is filled with all the lonely people
Trying to find their way
All they need is a hand to guide them
To a brighter day

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know you're searchin'

A little peace and understanding
And I know it's been hard tryin' to find your way
But you got to keep on searchin' harder day by day
'Cause I want you, and you, you, you, you, you, you, you you and you
To stand on up, yes sir
Put a little love in your heart
And little heart in your love
Together we can make a way

'Cause it's love, love's the only way

Oh, nothin' but love
Oh oh (Love)
Sweet love (Sweet love, ow)

Sweet love (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)Ah
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
Don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it

Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you

I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
Sweetest hangover

Yeah, I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get... over

Ooh, I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure

Sweet lovin'
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Don't call a doctor
Don't call her momma
Don't call her preacher

No, I don't need it
I don't want it

Sweet love, I love you
Sweet love, need love

If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it no
If there's a cure for this
I don't need it
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet loveDo you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Now looking back at all we've planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?I love to love you baby...

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby...

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin
In a spin

I love to love you baby...

Lay your head down real close to me
Soothe my mind and set me free
Set me free

I love to love you baby...

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby...

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin
In a spin

I love to love you baby...

I love to love you baby...

I love to love you baby...

Love to love you baby baby...

I love to love you baby...

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you baby...

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin
In a spin

I love to love you baby

Lay your head down so close to
Soothe my mind and set me free
Set me free

I love to love you baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be
Than with me here

I love to love you babyOh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
Oh, but I can't
Just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue

Oh honey, just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker to a flame
Listen to me good, baby
I think of the things we used to do
And my whole world turns misty blue

Baby, I should forget you
Heaven knows I tried
And baby, when I say that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied
I've lied, I've lied

Oh honey, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you, my love
My whole world turns misty blue

Oh, I can't, oh, I can't
Oh, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Oh, my love
My whole world turns misty blue
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blueAll alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more timeI must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
But when the grass got a little greener on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love, since I met you baby
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

Free on my own, that's the way I used to be
But since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me

(Fooled around and fell in love) Whoo, it's got ahold on me now, yeah
(Fooled around and fell in love) I can't let go of you baby
(Fooled around and fell in love) I can't stop loving you now
(Fooled around and fell in love) Hey
'Cause I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
Fooled around and fell in loveHello, yeah, it's been a while
Not much, how about you?
I'm not sure why I called
I guess I really just wanted to talk to you

And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for a while
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
And I'd really love to see you tonight

We could go walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV
You see it really doesn't matter much to me

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
And I'd really love to see you tonight

I won't ask for promises
So you don't have to lie
We've both played that game before
Say I love you and say goodbye

I'm not talking about moving in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing, the stars are out
And I'd really love to see you tonightWhen I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore
 
All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't want to live all by myself anymore

All by myself
Don't want to be all by myself anymoreI've just closed my eyes again
Climbed aboard the dream weaver train
Driver, take away my worries of today
And leave tomorrow behind

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Fly me high through the starry skies
Maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light

Though the dawn may be coming soon
There still may be some time
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon
And meet me on the other side

Ooh, dream weaver
I believe you can get me through the night
Ooh, dream weaver
I believe we can reach the morning light
Dream weaver
Dream weaverWell, I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have lived only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

There's something inside that's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Now could be forever

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive

There's a mirror moving inside my mind
Reflecting the love that you shine on me
Hold on now to that feeling
Let it flow, let it grow, yeah, yeah

My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah, girl, yeah

My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
My love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hoo, my love is alive
Woo hooThe legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
Then later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
When the wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
'Twas the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezing rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck
Sayin' "Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya"
At seven p.m. a main hatchway caved in
He said, "Fellas, it's been good to know ya"
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went out of sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does anyone know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below, Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come earlyI believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, baby?
How did you know I needed you?
How did you know I needed you so badly?
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly?
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now you're lying close to me, making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where you from, you sexy thing?
Sexy thing, you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, angel?
How did you know I'd be the one?
Did you know you're everything I prayed for?
Did you know, every night and day for?

Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want you to know, after all these years
You're still the one I want whispering in my ear

You're still the one I want to talk to in bed
Still the one that turns my head
We're still having fun and you're still the one

I looked at your face every day
But I never saw it 'til I went away
When winter came, I just wanted to go (Wanted to go)
Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow

You're still the one that makes me laugh
Still the one that's my better half
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You're still the one that makes me strong
Still the one I want to take along
We're still having fun and you're still the one
Yes, you are

Ooh
Ooh

Changing, our love is going gold
Even though we grow old, it grows new

You're still the one that I love to touch
Still the one and I can't get enough
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You're still the one who can scratch my itch
(You're) Still the one that I wouldn't switch
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You are still the one that makes me shout
Still the one that I dream about
We're still having fun and you're still the one

You are still the one
You're still the one
We're still having fun and you're still the one"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me
"The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover"

She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover"
50 ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Ooh, just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me 

Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said, "It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again"
I said, "I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways?"

She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
50 ways to leave your lover

You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me

Hop on the bus, Gus

Went to a party the other night
All the ladies were treatin' me right
Movin' my feet to the disco beat
How in the world could I keep my seat?

All of a sudden I began to change
I was on the dance floor actin' strange (Quack quack, quack quack)
Flappin' my arms, I began to cluck (Quack quack)
Look at me, I'm the Disco Duck

Ah, get down, mama
I've got to have me a woman, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Disco, disco duck
Got to have me a woman

Oh mama, shake your tail feather, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

When the music stopped I returned to my seat
But there's no stoppin' a duck and his beat (Quack quack, quack quack)
So I got back up to try my luck (Quack quack, quack quack)
Why look!

Whoa oh sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything
Whah oh sweet thing

I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right
Or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me baby
Don't walk away don't be so shady
Don't want your mind

These words I say they may sound funny
But

Don't you hear me talking baby
Love me now or I'll go crazyThe wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your okay
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way, ha-ha

Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right

We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smiling bright
I'll play the radio on Southern stations
'Cause Southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
A class of 7-4 gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again, ha-ha

Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right

We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
'Cause me and moon are itching to play
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way, ha-ha

Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels right
Moonlight 
Feels rightGonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right."
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day?
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?

Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite
But you got some bait a-waiting and I think I might
Like nibblin' a little afternoon delight

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down

Thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight
Afternoon delightI don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
O.K. you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before

Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy is on the run
F-foxy
Fox on the run and hide away

You, you talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second hand (second hand)
I've heard it all before
I don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before

Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes a running
Take a run and hide yourself away
Foxy on the run

Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they was blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks a-dancin' got all shook up

They started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old way you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Say if you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
It's gotta be some of that
If you wanna dance with meI want to know

And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you just one more time

When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

I had to meet you here today
There's just so many things to say
Please don't stop me till I'm through
This is something I hate to do

We've been meeting here so long
I guess what we done, oh was wrong
Please darling, don't you cry
Let's just kiss and say goodbye

Many months have passed us by

Whenever I think of you
My mind blows a fuse (baby)
When I look in your eyes

And I become confused

My voltage regulator cools
When I'm sitting next to you
Electricity starts to flow
And my indicator starts to glow, woo

While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do

I love music
Sweet, sweet music

All the joy that it's bringin'

I'm so happy to be in complete harmony,
I love you, girl
And to hold you so close in my arms

Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet

So mellow, mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arm
Oh honey, I love you, I love you, yeah

It's understood by every man, woman, boy and girl
And that's why, that's why I say
I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's groovin', groovin'

Music makes the atmosphere so fine
Lights down low
Just me and you baby, you know
'Specially when you got a cold glass of wine
Mellow, mellow wine and song

Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the drive-in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie, digging funky sound

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the pizza parlor (pizza parlor)
To get a bite to eat, now, now, yeah
I put some money in the jukebox for her
You know she ate her pizza dancing to the beat

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Uh-uh-huh, she's got the boogie fever
I think it's going around

(All night long we did the bump, bump, bump)
Yes we did, yes we did, yes we did, yeah
(We kept it going strong, doing the bump, bump, bump)
Doing the bump, bump, bump, yeah

I called the doctor on the telephone (doctor, doctor)
Said doctor, doctor, please, I, I, I
I got this feeling, rocking and a-reeling
Tell me, what can it be, is it some new disease

They call it boogie fever
You got to boogie down, uh-huh-huh, just get on down

Yeah, hey

Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer
Playing in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burning down the one-night stands

Then everything around me, yeah
It got to start to feeling so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh heh
'Til you die, yeah (What?)
Hear, hear, heh

A-heh, I tried to understand this (Yeah)
Heh, I thought that they were out of their minds
Heh, how could I be so foolish, how could I
To not see I was the one behind?

So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?)
I said, "I must go back there", I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music, white boy (Yeah)
Play that funky music right, oh
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh

'Til you die (Yeah)
Whoa, 'til you die
Gonna play some electrified funky music, yow!

Ah ha ha

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock and roll and minds
Yeah, things were getting shaky
(Yeah) I thought I'd have to leave it behind, uh

Ooh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh heh
'Til you die (Yeah)
Oh, 'til you die, yeah
Come on, let's go!

(They shouted, play that funky music) Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) You gotta keep on playing funky music
(Play that funky music) Play that funky music
(Play that funky music) Come on and take you higher

Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right, yeah
Play that funky music, white boy

But look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, now can't you see
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see
What's wrong with that
I need to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you
I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly
Love isn't silly at all, yeah, yeah

How can I tell you about my loved one
How can I tell you about my loved one
How can I tell you about my loved one
How can I tell you about my loved one

I love you
I love you
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you

I love you 

You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with thatToo many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
When you're feeling like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up

Ooh, you made me love you
Ooh, you've got a way
Ooh, you had me crawling up the wall

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
When you're feeling like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up

Ooh, you made me love you
Ooh, you've got a way
Ooh, you had me crawling up the wall

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for loveOoh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go, mm
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a tease, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Digging the dancing queenCrying on my pillow, lonely in my bed
Then I heard a voice beside me and she softly said
Wonder is your night light, magic is your dream
And as I held her, she said, see what I mean

I said what? 
She said oo-oo-oo wee
I said all right
She said love me, love me, love me

Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere) Yeah, somewhere

Heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow (undercover)
I'm givin' up my heart to you, now angel don't go
She said, go find the right one, love her and then (undercover)
When you look into her eyes, you'll see me again

I said what? 
She said oo-oo-oo wee
I said all right
She said love me, love me, love me

Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there
(Somewhere) Woah, somewhere

Now you know my story and, girl, if it's right
I'm gonna take you in my arms and love you tonight
Underneath the covers, the answer lies
I'm lookin' for my angel in your sweet lovin' eyes

She said what? 
I said oo-oo-oo wee
She said all right
I said lay next to me
She said what? 
I said oo-oo-oo wee
She said all right
She said love me, love me, love me

Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me (ooh)
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me

Love me, love me, love me

Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there

Out there somewhereFor so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

Darling, mine
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you, darling
This love will shine, girl
Watch it and see
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the Heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string

Oh, if I, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything
To be your everything

Darling, for so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more then strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string

Oh, if I, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything
To be your everything

I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string

Oh, if I, if I stay here without you, darling, I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
'Cause I'd do anything
To be your everythingLove, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and exite us 'cause we have the brightest love

Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever, evergreenI got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornin's I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me.

Can we believe in fairytales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me.

But now my love, hey didn't I love you
But we knew what had to be
Somehow my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me.

Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me
Don't ask why.
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me.

(Girls)
But now my love, hey didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you, baby.

Don't cry my love
I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me.

I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart belongs to me.

(Didn't I love you, didn't I love you).There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you

Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

Oh no, we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Oh, we made it

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Looks like we made it
Oh babe, we made itWhen we met, it wasn't quite clear to me
What you had in store was there for only me
Silly, you know you took me by surprise
Then I turned and looked, I saw that message in your eye

There you were, I fell on the floor
The way you move, girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin' in my eyes

I know I had to hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time
In ecstasy when you're layin' down next to me
Oh, no, no, ecstasy, yeah, when you're layin' down next to me

I find it hard for me to concentrate
If I don't make my move, girl, it might be too late
I've got to make sure you don't get away
After all you done, girl, to make me wanna stay

All my life I've been searchin' for a star
Now my search is over and here we are
Livin' in ecstasy, yeah, when you lay down next to me, yeah
Here in ecstasy, when you're layin' down next to me

I wanna hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time
Livin' in ecstasy, well, when you're layin' down next to me
Ooh! ooh! wee, ecstasy, when you're layin' here with me, uh-huh

In this ecstasy when you are here with me, yeah
Oh, it's ecstasy, Lord knows when you're next to me, yeahTrying hard now
It's so hard now
Trying hard now

Getting strong now
Won't be long now
Getting strong now

Gonna fly now
Flying high now
Gonna fly, fly, fly...I was a little too tall, could've used a few pounds
Tight pants, points, hardly renowned
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high
Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

Workin' on our night moves
Trying' make some front-page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves

In the summertime
Mm, in the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searching for some high in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword

And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backrooms, an alley, or trusty woods
I used her, she used me, but neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to lose some awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves, mm
And it was summertime
Mm, sweet summertime, summertime

Oh, the wonderin'
I felt the lightning, yeah
Waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off, I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

Mm, night moves
Mm (night moves) Night moves
(Night moves) Yeah
(Night moves) I remember
(Night moves) Ah, I sure remember the night moves
(Night moves) Ain't it funny how you remember
(Night moves) Funny how you remember
(Night moves) I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember
(Night moves) Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Night moves) Remember working, working and practicing
(Night moves) Working and practicing
(Night moves) Oh, for the night moves, night moves
(Night moves) Oh
(Night moves) I remember, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Night moves) I remember, ooh
(Night moves) I remember, Lord I remember, Lord I remember
(Night moves) Ho, oh

Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I remember, I rememberI looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
Then lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
Till I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away

So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
Till I see Marianne walk away

I see my Marianne walkin' away

When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away

She slipped away

It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)
And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)
Till I see Marianne walk awayEverybody go on and dance if you want to

Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best

I wasn't looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your lovelight

But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you

That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darling you're the best

Baby, you're the best
Baby, you're the bestTime was drifting, this rock had got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling really got a hold
I started searching for a better way

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

L.A. fever made me feel right
But I must admit it got the best of me
Getting down, so deep I coulda drowned
I can't get back the way I used to be

But I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
Couldn't get it right

New York City took me with the tide
But I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another no-account fatality

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
Couldn't get it right

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night

Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye

I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But, honey, now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue

Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes

Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer 
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening 
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know 
We can still come through

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, babySo many nights I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark, but now you've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey, I love you
Never again to be all alone

'Cause you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

'Cause you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you, you light up my lifeOn a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be heaven or this could be hell"
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine!"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in their masters' chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax", said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave"There's talk on the street
It sounds so familiar 
Great expectations
Everybody's watching you 

People you meet
They all seem to know you 
Even your old friends
Treat you like you're something new 

Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down

You look in her eyes
The music begins to play 
Hopeless romantics
Here we go again 

But after awhile
You're lookin' the other way 
It's those restless hearts 
That never mend 

Oh, Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you
When you're not around?

There's so many things
You should have told her
But night after night 
You're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder 

There's talk on the street
It's there to remind you
That it doesn't really matter 
Which side you're on 

You're walking away
And they're talking behind you 
They will never forget you
Till somebody new comes along 

Where you been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
And he's holding her
And you're still around

Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town

Ooh, hoo
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's walkin' like the new kid in town

There's a new kid in town 
I don't want to hear it 
There's a new kid in town 
I don't want to hear it 
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town

There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town
People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in townIf you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about the times to come?
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh...Now here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again
I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
A-what you had
Ooh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh, oh, oh, you'll knowI would climb any mountain
Sail across the stormy sea
If that's what it takes me, baby
To show how much you mean to me

And I guess it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time

I have waited a lifetime
Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I've found you
Together we'll make history

And I know it must be the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all my eyes can see

And it feels like the first time
Like it never did before
Feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
Feels like the first time
Like it never will again, never again

(It feels like the first time) It feels like the first time
(It feels like the very first time) Talkin' 'bout it feels
(It feels like the first time) Oh, it feels like the first time
(It feels like the very first time)

Won't you open up the door?

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first timeSouthern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when you close your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies?
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories of old

Old man, he and his dog
They walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........

Mystery like this and
Many others in the trees
Blow in the night in the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........Boogie nights, whoa

I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light

I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine
We've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times
Hand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand
Side by side, the tide rolls in
I'm touching you, you're touching me
If only it could be

I like dreamin' 'cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light

Through each dream how our love has grown
I see us with our children and our happy home
Little smiles, so warm and tender, looking up at us
Blessed by love, the world we share
Until I wake, I reach for you
And you're just not there

I like dreamin' 'cause dreaming can make you mine
I like holding you close, touching your skin
Even if it's in my mind

Ooh, sweet dream baby, I love you
Mm, my sweet dream baby, don't keep waitin' all my life, I need you
Sweet dream baby, I love you
Ooh, sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night
Ooh, sweet dream baby, I like dreamin', yeah
Mm, sweet dream baby, don't keep waiting any longer, I love youIn a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her, she said, "I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings"

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused; he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin', his big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said

"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"

After he left us, I ordered more whisky
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time

"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, LucilleWhen I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be travelin' forever
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you, babe
It's only a heartbeat away

It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be travelin' a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out
And do like I do
Oh, I need you

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keepin' me warm night and day

When I need you
I just close my eyes
And you're right here by my side
Keepin' me warm night and day

I just hold out my hands
I just hold out my hands
And I'm with you darlin'
Yes, I'm with you darlin'

And all I want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away
Oh, I need you darlin'
Oh, I want you(Ah, aha, ah, aha)

You've got a cute way of talking
You've got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead

I'm in the spin, you know 
Shaking on a string, you know 

You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, (ooh) dancing, ah

Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired, no, no, no, no, no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't wanna go home

You put a spell on me
Right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, ah

You take me higher
I want to catch a fire, 'cause

You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
(I'm gonna dance the night away)
You make me feel like dancing
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, (ooh)
Dance the night away, yeah 
I feel like dancing (ooh) dancing, ah

You really slip me emotion
I can't get off of the floor
All this perpetual motion
You gotta give me some more
You gotta give me some more

And if you'll let me stay 
We'll dance our lives away

You make me feel like dancing 
(I wanna dance my life away)
You make me feel like dancing 
(I wanna dance my life away)
You make me feel like dancing

'Cause I was too nervous to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought somebody could choose me

No more standing there beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin', there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, spread out and let me in

Baby, just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up, turn it 'round
Ooh, shake it down, ow

If you want it, you've got to give it upThere are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else

Into the future
Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the future

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
Till I'm free
Oh, Lord, through the revolution

Feed the babies
Who don't have enough to eat
Shoe the children
With no shoes on their feet
House the people
Living in the street
Oh oh, there's a solution

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
Till I'm free
Right through the revolution

Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the future
Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the future

I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly like an eagle
Till I'm free
Right through the revolution

Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the future
Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the futureLookin' back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside!"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, an' I'll give you anythin' you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes, writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands

But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget:
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringin' out
There's no way the band could lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all over, all over people

Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people
Come on!Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins, dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask or is it cool, is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a fewDoesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way ya make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

Oh yeah (my love, my love)
Oh, oh yeah (my love, my love)

Oh, you've got the best of my love

Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Oh, this dude is outta sight
Everything he does
Seems to come out right

Once I went to hear them play
At a club outside of town
I was so surprised, I was hypnotized
By the sound this cat put down
When I saw this short, fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the man got down
When he finally reached his goal

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Got that rubber band
Up on his toes
And then he wriggled it up
All around his nose

Guaranteed to blow your mind
Playin' all that music, yet keepin' time
Where in the world did he learn that, oh, Lord
Lord, help him get away

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband man, rubberband man
How much of this stuff do he think we can stand?
So much rhythm, grace, and debonair for one man, Lord
And then he had the nerve to twiggle his left toe
Slip it through his knee, got the feeling in his head, y'all
Aw, come on, baby

Hey, y'all, prepare yourself for the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to lose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Rubberband man starts to jam
Moving up and down cross the land
Got the people all in his wake
Everything probably seems outta place

Just move it, just move it
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man
Just move it, just move it
Just move, move, move it
Just, rubberband, rubberband man

If you need me, let me know
Gonna be around
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down

If you're all alone
When the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best
And it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test
If you let me try

Take a chance on me
(Come on, give me a break, will you?)
Take a chance on me

Oh, you can take your time baby
I'm in no hurry
Know I'm gonna get you
You don't wanna hurt me
Baby, don't worry
I ain't gonna let you

Let me tell you now, my love is strong enough
To last when things are rough, it's magic
You say that I waste my time
But I can't get you off my mind
You know, I can't let go
'Cause I love you so

If you change your mind
I'm the first in line
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know
Gonna be around
If you've got no place to go
If you're feeling down

If you're all alone
When the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best
Baby, can't you see
Gotta put me to the test
Take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best
Baby, can't you see
Gotta put me to the test
Take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best
Baby, can't you see
Gotta put me to the test
Take a chance on me
(Fade)I don't know how
This whole business started
Of you thinkin' that 
I had been untrue

But if you think that
We'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but 
I'll break away from you

Well, just give me the sign
And I will be gone, yeah

That's how much I feel
Feel for you baby
How much I need
I need your touch
How much I live
I live for your lovin'
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much, ooh

Sleep alone and 
Late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness 
That seems to be leavin' me

Oh no, I'd give it all and 
Then I'd, give some more
If you would only love me
Like you had before

Oh, take hold of my hand
And all will be forgiven

That's how much I feel
Feel for you baby
How much I need
I need your touch
How much I live
I live for your lovin'
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much

So you try
Try to stay in the middle
And then you cry
Well, you cry just a little
Then we both realize
Just how foolish you've been
Ooh, and you try to make amends
But you're better off as friends

'Cause that's how much
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much, ooh

How's your life been goin' on?
I got a wife now
Years we've been going strong

Oh no, there's just something 
That I got to say
Sometimes when we make love
I still can see your face
Ooh, just try to recall
When we were as one, yeah

That's how much I feel
Feel for you baby
How much I need
I need your touch
How much I live
I live for your loving
That's how much
That's how muchLove is higher than a mountain 
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Say, my mind, should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

Love is higher than a mountain 
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Say, my thought, should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la...I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain 

I was losing you before I ever held you tight 
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do 

Ah, we got an everlasting love 
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream                                    
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Take me out of the cold
Give me what I've hungered for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more

I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try

Ah, we got an everlasting love 
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above
The rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears
Of yesterday, we killed the pain, we blew away
The memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never dieYou got me looking at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head

And in a world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way

I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

And in this world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you, oh

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing moreI cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed meYou know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm findin' it hard to do anything

You see I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm goin' through
I just can't smile without you

You came along just like a song
And brightened my day
Who'da believed that you were part of a dream?
Now it all seems light years away

And now you know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm findin' it hard to do anything

You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm goin' through
I just can't smile without you

Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find
Well I'm finding it hard leavin' your love behind me

And you see I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm findin' it hard to do anything

You see I feel glad when you're glad
I feel sad when you're sad
If you only knew what I'm goin' through
I just can't smile without you... you... lalalalaAh

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? 
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? 
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love

Ah
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us beListen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's something we can share
We can steal it

And that sweet city woman
She move through the light
Controllin' my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, girl
And the feelin' is right

I get that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Born on the wind
Makin' it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough
To take us to the mornin'

I got fire in my mind
I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowing in the dark
I give you warning

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controllin' my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, girl
And the feelin' is right

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it (Feels like forever, baby, don't you know?)
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Born on the wind
Making it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it (Feels like forever, baby, don't you know?)
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it (I'll leave you never, baby, don't you know?)

Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do it (Feels like forever, baby, don't you know?)
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it (I'll leave you never, baby, don't you know?)

Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to do itWell you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
But now it's all right, that's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
Oh when you walk

Well now I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose
You know it's all right, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
I'm we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
Ahh

Life going nowhere somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
Now it's all right, it's okay
And you can look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
I'm we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive

Life going nowhere somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life going nowhere somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' aliveDon't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before, mmm
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh, but what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said I love you, that's forever
And this I promise from the heart, mmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are, right

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you areYou always won every time you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same
I caught up with you yesterday
Moving game to game
No one standing in your way
Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by
You're still the same
You still aim high

There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say

'Cause you're still the same
You're still the same
Moving game to game
Some things never change
You're still the sameIt's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right, with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It ain't right, with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Ah, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It's a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It's a fool's gameDon't look back a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin' today is the day

And I can see it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes I will

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'

It's a bright horizon and I'm awake now
Oh I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin', the clouds are breakin'
‘Cause I can't lose now there's no game to play

I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong, oh, yes I can

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind, left behind

Oh the sun is shinin'
And I'm on that road

Don't look back a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin' today is the day

And I can see it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes I will

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind

Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look backInstrumentalThanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

You shared my dreams, my joys, my pains
You made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my life over again, dear
I'd spend each and every moment with you

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

When we are together, the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you, to feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love youYou ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsidesHere you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go

Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I goLast dance

YeahSpring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left my cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no
Oh, yeahThere is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies
Love is all that matters, won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

I long to see the morning light
Colouring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye

I've been from one to another extreme
It's time I had a good time, ain't got time to wait
I wanna stick around till I can't see straight

Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision gets the best of me

Never do more than I, I really need
My mind is racing, but my body's in the lead
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna push it to the limit
I live all of my years in a single minute

Fill my eyes with that double vision
No disguise for that double vision
Ooh, when it gets through to me, it's always new to me
My double vision always seems to get the best of me, the best of me, yeah-ah

Ooo oooh, double vision
I need my double vision
It takes me out of my head
Taking me out of my head
I get my double vision, ooh
Seeing double, double
Oh, want my double vision
Yeah-ahh, I get double vision, ooh
How long, how long is my visionWell, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

You don't have to read my mind
To know what I have in mind
Honey, you oughta know
Now you move so fine
Let me lay it on the line
I wanna know what you're doin' after the show

Now it's up to you
We can make a secret rendezvous
Just me and you
I'll show you lovin' like you never knew

That's why I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded

If it feels all right
Maybe you can stay all night
Shall I leave you my key?
But you've got to give me a sign
Come on girl, some kind of sign
Tell me, are you hot, mama?
You sure look that way to me

Are you old enough?
Will you be ready when I call your bluff?
Is my timing right?
Did you save your love for me tonight?

Yeah, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
Feel the fever burnin' inside of me
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded (I'm hot)

Now it's up to you
Can we make a secret rendezvous?
Oh, before we do
You'll have to get away from you-know-who

Well, I'm hot blooded, check it and see
I got a fever of a hundred and three
Come on baby, do you do more than dance?
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded

(Hot blooded) Every night
(Hot blooded) You're lookin' so tight
(Hot blooded) Now you're drivin' me wild
(Hot blooded, hot blooded) I'm so hot for you, child

(Hot blooded) I'm a little bit high
(Hot blooded) You're a little bit shy
(Hot blooded) You're makin' me sing
(Hot blooded, hot blooded) For your sweet sweet thingI solve my problems and I see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believing now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand, it's just a crying shame
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel
Grease is the word

(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word

(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling

This is a life of illusion 
Wrapped up in trouble
Laced with confusion
What are we doing here?

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are (be who we are)
Grease is the word 

(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling

(Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Now, grease is the way we are feeling

Grease is the word

Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything

This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're crying, you're crying now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
And when you wake up, it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
And you're going, you're going homeFor your love
When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Ooh, I tried so hard to take it
But oh Lord my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you babe
I just gotta stop
For your love

When I think about the way the world must turn
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me
Memories of life and times go on and on
Ooh, I've tried hard to forget it
But of Lord my mind won't let it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you babe
I just wanna stop
For your love

Ooh, I've tried so hard to take it
But oh Lord my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
The world ain't right without you babe
I just wanna stop
For your loveWhenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anywhere we are
You and I have always been ever and ever

I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do always takes me home to you
Ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it right

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be
Forever and ever

I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
Never seen such a beautiful sight
See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light

See love flowin' on us every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it, doin' it, doin' it

Sweet love, sweet love, yeah
You're the glowing light in my life
So, so bright in my life
Oh, everything I do sends me back to you
Whenever I call you friendI feel so bad, I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come with me to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be.

Oh, that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside
Well, I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue BayouFriday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

How to tell you, girl
I wanna build my world around you
Tell you that it's true
I wanna make you understand 
I'm talking about a lifetime plan

That's the way it began
We were hand-in-hand
Glenn Miller's band 
Was better than before
We yelled and screamed for more

And the Porter tune (Night and Day)
Made us dance across the room
It ended all too soon
And on the way back home 
I promised you'd never be alone

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscing

Friday night, it was late
I was walking you home
We got down to the gate
And I was dreaming of the night
Would it turn out right?

Now as the years roll on
Each time we hear our favorite song
The memories come along
Older times we're missing
Spending the hours reminiscing

Hurry, don't be late
I can't hardly wait
I said to myself when we're old
We'll go dancing in the dark
Walking through the park
And reminiscingDanger in the shape of somethin' wild
Stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child
No one knows who she is or what her name is
I don't know where she came from or what her game is

Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Hot child in the city

So young to be loose and on her own
Young boys, they all want to take her home
She goes downtown, the boys all stop and stare
When she goes downtown, she walks like she just don't care, yeah

Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty, yeah
Hot child in the city

Come on down to my place, baby
We'll talk about love
Come on down to my place, woman
We'll make love

Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
She's kinda dangerous
(Hot child in the city)
Young child
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)
Young child, runnin' wild
(Hot child in the city)

Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
(Hot child in the city)
(Hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
Oh

Hot childGuess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you

I know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
My heart is saying, "Don't let go"
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm outta my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to youSlip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a man, he came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said Dolores I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering 
I'm afraid that I will disappear

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a woman, became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said a good day ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a father who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
He came a long way just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

He's slip slidin'
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And God only knows, God makes his plan
The information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're working our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' awaySpending all my nights, all my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes, I'm right back where I started again
And trying to forget you is just a waste of time

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you

Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong, and I just can't live without you
I was wrong, and I just can't live

Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on meShort people got no reason
Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason to live

They got little hands
Little eyes
They walk around tellin' great big lies
They got little noses
And tiny little teeth
They wear platform shoes on their nasty little feet

Well I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people 'round here

(Short people are just the same as you and I)
A fool such as I
(All men are brothers until the day they die)
It's a wonderful world

Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody to love

They got little baby legs
They stand so low
You gotta pick 'em up
Just to say hello
They got little cars that go "beep, beep, beep"
They got little voices goin' "peep, peep, peep"
They got grubby little fingers
And dirty little minds
They're gonna get you every time

Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people 'round hereI didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
Oh

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience

The big-bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad-lib lines were well-rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
 
My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance

You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But, honey, what do you see in me?

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
 
You're an essay in glamour, please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but, baby, I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
'Cause you're the warmest thing I've ever found

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
Yeah, yeah

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soulIt's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside, oh
And who is the one you're clingin' to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now
Now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
But you never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night
Good night

I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are, ah
But you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night

And where are you now
Now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darlingOoh, good loving
The girl's got plenty good loving
Ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so
She use to be my girl, I

I, I respect her
When she was mine
I use to neglect her
Ah, she wanted more than I could give
But as long as I live
She'll be my girl, she

She use to be my girl
She use to be my girl
She had a charming personality
The girl was so right for me
She's my girl

And if I had the chance
Lord knows I'd take her back
As a matter of fact
Right away, like today

Not only good looking
The girl was so smart
You can't beat her cooking
Ah, ask me how I know
And I'll tell you so
She use to be my girl, ooh-ooh

Deep down inside I still love her
I place no one above her
She's warm and sensitive
For as long as I live
She'll be my girl

And if I had the chance
I'd take her back, Lord knows
As a matter of fact
Right away, like today, ooh, well

Ooh, good loving
The girl's got plenty good loving

And I'll tell you so
She use to be my girl, my girl

She use to be, she use to be my girl (Lord knows)
She use to be my girl (I wouldn't lie about a thing like that)
She use to be my girl (honest fellas, honest fellas)
She use to be my girl (she was mine, all mine, all mine)
She use to be my girl (my girl)
She use to be my girl (girl, yeah)
She use to be my girl (yeah, my girl)

Deep down inside I still love her
I'll place no one above her
Got to say, sure do, sure do
Sure do, dough, dough
Dough, dough, dough, dough, dough
She was mine, all mine
She was mine

She use to be my girl (honest, fellas)
She use to be my girl (I know you don't believe me, but she did)
She use to be my girl (I wouldn't lie)
She use to be my girl (I know it'll hurt me to say goodbye)I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I wanna kiss you, sometime

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you child
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
Your phone rings

It's just a friend of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dying to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

Ooh baby why you wait so long
Ooh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come home, come home

I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stuffling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometime I wanna say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
Hoo ho-hoo yeah
Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
I miss you child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I wanna kiss you child
You just been plucking out my mind
Fooling on my time
Lord, I wanna kiss you baby, yeah
Lord, I miss you child
Oooh hoo aaahh

Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you childWith a little luck we can help it out
We can make this whole damn thing work out
With a little love we can lay it down
Can't you feel the town exploding

There is no end to what we can do together
There is no end
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
And if he can do it, we can do it
Just me and you

And a little luck, we can clear it up
We can bring it in for a landing
With a little luck we can turn it on
There can be no misunderstanding

There is no end to what we can do together
There is no end
The willow turns his back on inclement weather
We can do it, just me and you

With a little push we could set it off
We could send it rocketing skywards
With a little luck we could shake it up
Don't you feel the comet exploding

With a little luck we could lay it down
Can't you feel the town exploding
With a little push we could set it off
We can send it rocketing skyward
With a little luck we could shake it up
Don't you feel the comet exploding
Woah, woah, woah, wooohDon't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end and it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears of love are a waste of time if I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh

Can't let go, and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily, to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah, oh

Oh, if I can't have you, I don't want nobody, baby

You don't sing me love songs 

You hardly talk to me anymore 
When I come through the door at the end of the day... 

I remember when you couldn't wait to love me 
Used to hate to leave me 
Now after loving me late at night 

When it's good for you, babe 
And you're feeling all right 

When you just roll over and turn out the light... 
And you don't bring me flowers anymore 

It used to be so natural 

It used to be...

To talk about forever 

Mmm... 

But used-to-bes don't count anymore 
They just lay on the floor 
Till we sweep them away 

And baby I remember all the things you taught me 

I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry 

Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie 

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye 

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye 
You don't bring me flowers any more... 

Well, you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye... 

'Cause you don't say you need me; 

You don't sing me love songs

You don't bring me flowers anymore...Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise, oh
Oh, what you trying to do

Livin' on your cheating and the pain
Grows inside me, it's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever, but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you

You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I'm the man who
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire

Oh, wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever, we won't ever feel the storm

I ain't no vision, I'm the man who
Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire

Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word, I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me, I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I'm the man who
Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire

Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire

Love you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fireNobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Ooh, you and me, girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

And, my love
I can see beyond forever
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Ah, you and me, girl
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night or day
And the tears we had to cry

You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we own will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing, oh
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river
And harder to cross

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh, oh, oh
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climbHere I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time, in a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home, I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Ah, tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Ah, tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you you're goin' nowhereGot a call from an old friend we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold a house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said)

I still belong (still belong)
Don't get me wrong (get me wrong)
You can speak your mind but not on my time

They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way it's okay, you wake up with yourself

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(Of circumstance)

I still belong (still belong)
Don't get me wrong (get me wrong)
You can speak your mind but not on my time

I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

(Keep it to yourself, it's my life)
(Keep it to yourself, it's my life)
(Keep it to yourself, it's my life), Azula!
(Keep it to yourself, it's my life)

Azula!Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin' my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're usin', please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruisin', yeah

yeah, ridin' high
On love's true bluish lie

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you doGood times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right for making friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten?
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again

Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute ponytails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporty life

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate?
You silly fool, you can't change your fate

Let's cut the rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and roller-skates, roller-skates

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around

Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!Sail on down the line, 'bout a
Half a mile or so, and I
Don't really wanna know
Where you're going

Maybe once or twice, you see
Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got, but
Now you're going

And I don't mind
About the things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name, yeah, yeah

Guess I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line, ain't it
Funny how the time can go
Friends say they told me so, but it
Doesn't matter

It was plain to see that a
Small town boy like me just-a
Wasn't your cup of tea, I was
Wishful thinking

I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away, yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time, good time, yeah

I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away, yeah, yeah

Got nothing else to lose
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time, good time

Oh-oh, sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good

(Sail on)
(Sail on)
(Sail on)Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me, you said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart you needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all, I do love you
Still

Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind

So many dreams that flew away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go
Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all, I do love you
Still

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see
But then most of all, I do love you

StillMakin' it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Makin' it

I'm solid gold
I've got the goods
They stand when I walk
Through the neighborhoods

I'm makin' it
I've got the chance
I'm takin' it
No more, no more
Fakin' it
This time in life
I'm makin' it (oh-oh-oh)
Makin' it

Hello uptown
Goodbye poverty
The top of the ladder is waiting for me
I'm makin' it
I've got the chance
I'm takin' it
No more, no more
Fakin' it
This time in life
I'm makin' it (oh-oh-oh)

Listen everyone here
This coming year's gonna be my year
I'm as bad as they come
Number two to no one
I've got looks, I've got brains
And I'm breakin' these chains
Make some room now dig what you see
Success is mine
I've got the key
I'm makin' itYou looked inside my fantasies
And made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one
Since you took me in
I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow
Reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow
If you should go away

I'll stand here and remember
Just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold onYou get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
"We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"Toot toot hey beep beep

But you want a good time

You ask yourself
Who they are
Like everybody else
They come from near and far

Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight

But either way, there's gonna be
A heartache tonight, a heartache tonight
Oh, I know
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know, whoo hoo
Break my heartYou got me running, going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm telling you, it's got to be the end
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, grroosss!
Don't bring me down, grroosss!
Don't bring me down, grroosss!
Don't bring me down

What happened to the girl I used to know?
You let your mind out somewhere down the road
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talking 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days, you're gonna get it right
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, grroosss!
Don't bring me down, grroosss!
Don't bring me down, grroosss!

You're looking good, just like a snake in the grass
One of these days, you're gonna break your glass
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You got me shaking, got me running away
You got me crawling up to you everyday
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-hoo
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down

I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me downInstrumentalAt first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Oh

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
I will surviveInstrumentalWhen the lights go down in the California town
People are in for the evening
I jump into my car and I throw in my guitar
My heartbeat in time with my breathing

Driving over Kanan
Singing to my soul
There's people out there 
Turning music into gold

Ah, my buddy Jim Bass
He's a-working pumping gas
And he makes two-fifty for an hour

He's got rhythm in his hands
As he's tapping on the cans
Sings rock and roll in the shower

Driving over Kanan
Singing to his soul
There's people out there 
Turning music into gold

Ah, California girls are the greatest in the world
Each one a song in the making
Singing right to me, I can hear the melody
Story is there for the taking

Driving over Kanan
Singing to his soul
There's people out there 
Turning music into gold

(Ooh)

Driving over Kanan
Singing to my soul
There's people out there 
Turning music into gold

When the lights go down in the California town
People are in for the evening
I jump into my car and I throw in my guitar
My heartbeat in time with my breathing

Driving over Kanan
Singing to my soul
There's people out there 
Turning music into gold

Flying over Kanan, singing to my soul
People out there turning music into gold
People out there turning music into gold
People out there turning music into gold

(Ooh, yeah)

People out there turning music into gold (into gold)
People out there turning music into gold (into gold)
People out there turning music into gold (into gold)
(Yes, babe)
People out there turning music into gold (into gold)
People out there turning music into gold (into gold)
Rappin' on the radio
People out there turning music into gold (into gold)
Slippin' down the back road
People out there turning music into gold (into gold)While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for meI have often heard you say you love me as a friend
But I love you more than anyone
You know I can't pretend no longer
I would give you anything
I'd throw my world away
But you don't wanna hear that anymore
And you wanna hear me say

Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you, I know it's right
I'll always need you
I'll never leave you
Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long
I'd rather be a fool with a broken heart
Than someone who never had a part of you

You know I told you from the start exactly how I feel
Time goes on
It seems nothing's changed
I'm in love for real
We have never played the games that real lovers do
So maybe we are better off
But baby, I'd still like this from you

Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you, I know it's right
I'll always need you
I'll never leave you
Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long
I'd rather be a fool with a broken heart
Than someone who never had a part of youYou know, I was,
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on,
Because the force,
It's got a lot of power,
And it make me feel like ah,
It make me feel like... oooh!

Lovely 
Is the feeling now
Fever 
Temperature's rising now
Power (ah power) 
Is the force the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why (ooh)
So get closer (closer now) 
To my body now

'Til you don't know how (ooh)

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Don't stop 'til you get enough

Touch me 
And I feel on fire
Ain't nothing 
Like a love desire (ooh)

Like hot candle wax
Sensation (ah sensation) 
Lovely where we at (ooh)
So let love 
Take us through the hours

'Cause this is love power (ooh)

Don't stop 'til you get enoughNight is dragging her feet
I wait alone in the heat
I know, know that you'll have your way
'Til you have to go home
No's a word I can't say

'Cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go

Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms, in the web of your lies

But it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go

Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

Gets me nowhere to tell you no
It gets me nowhere to make you go

Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

Gets me nowhere to tell you no
It gets me nowhere to make you go

Will a little more love make you stop depending?
Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

Gets me nowhere to tell you no
It gets me nowhere to make you goI was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had
Has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you 'cause I want you bad, hey, hey

I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such
A way of learning so much
I know now that I love you 'cause I need your touch, hey, hey

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

I sat here staring at the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb
Right through the telephone line
And give you what you want so you will still be mine, hey, hey

I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce
On precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together, 'cause I missed your kiss, hey, hey

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby

Oh, lover, lover, this is solid love
And you're exactly what I'm dreaming of
All through the day
And all through the night
I'll give you all the love I have with all my might, hey, hey

Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

Ooh, listen baby
I won't ever make you cry
I won't let one day go by
Without holding you
Without kissing you
Without loving you
Reunited

You're my everything
Only you know how to free
All the love there is in me
I wanna let you know
I won't let you go
I wanna let you know
I won't let you go
Reunited

Reunited and it feels so good

Do it too you allYou packed in the morning, I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way

But I miss you more than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Left me just when I needed you most

Now most every morning, I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me

'Cause I need you more than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Left me just when I needed you most

You packed in the morning, I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way

Now I love you more than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Oh yeah, you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you mostHow come he don't come and P.L.P. with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn off the TV
And hang that sign on the door?
Well, we call, and we call
"How come?", we say
Hey, what could make a boy behave this way, yeah?

Well, he learned all of the lines now
And every time
He don't, uh, stutter when he talks
And it's true, it's true
He sure has acquired
This kind of cool and inspired sort of jazz when he walks
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
If, if this ain't healthy, it is some kinda clean

But that means that Chuck E.'s in love, my, my
Chuck E.'s in love, love, love, love
Chuck E.'s in love, uh-huh
Chuck E.'s in

I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something that I've got to see
Is he here?
I look in the pool hall
But is he here?
I look in the drugstore
But is he here?
No, he don't come here no more

Well, I tell you what
I saw him
He was sittin' behind us
Down at the Pantages
And whatever it is
That he's got up his sleeve
Well, I hope it isn't contagious

What's her name?
Is that her there?
Oh, Christ, I think he's even combed his hair
And is that her?
Well, then, what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be the same
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E.'s in love with the little girl singing this song
And don't you know

Chuck E.'s in love, yeah, yeah
Chuck E.'s in love, love, love, love
Chuck E.'s in love, my, my
Chuck E.'s in

Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
He's in love, love, love with meLooks like it's over, you knew I couldn't stay
She's coming home today
We had a good thing, I'll miss your sweet love
Why must you look at me that way, it's over

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Try to remember the magic that we shared
In time your broken heart will mend
I never used you, you knew I really cared
I hate to sit and defend, but it's over

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Sad eyes, turn the other way
I don't want to see you cry (cry, cry, cry)
Sad eyes, you knew there'd come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Sad eyes, turn the other waySurely, sugar, hmm

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all her questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

"If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know"
"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so
Tell me so, baby"

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
"Come on, honey, let's spend the night together"
"Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother"
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

"If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey, tell me so"
"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know"
Ooh

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
"Relax, baby, now we're all alone"
Ow

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, "I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee"
"Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie"

"If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know"
"If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so"
Ooh

Sugar

If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
Hmm
If you really want me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, j-just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so
Mm-hmm

The time is drawing near
My train is going, I see it in your eyes
The love, the need, your tears

But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

You know it's you, babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you, babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

Babe, I'm leaving, I'll say it once again
Somehow try to smile
I know the feeling we're trying to forget
If only for a while

'Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
Please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you
Babe, I love you

Ooh, babeOur love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I've fallen for you
Whatever you do
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I never knew
Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you

Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

You were so young
Ah, and I was so free
I may have been young but, baby, that's not what I wanted to be
Well, you were the one
Oh, why was it me?
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I'd never seen
Whatever you need, baby, you got it from me

Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Stumblin' in
Stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Ah, stumblin' in
Mmm, stumblin' in
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Oh, stumblin' in
I'm stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Oh, oh, stumblin' in (ah, stumblin' in)
I'm stumblin' in (you were stumblin' in)
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' inThe devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said: "Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you"

The boy said: "My name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been"

Johnny, you rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case and he said: "I'll start this show"
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the devil finished Johnny said:
"Well, you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair, right there
And let me show you how it's done"

Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said: "Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
And I've told, you once you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been"

And he played Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house of the rising sun
The chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, noHe came from somewhere back in here long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate what had yet to be created
Once in her life she musters a smile
For his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in here long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power
To reason away
What seems to be (If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing (Fool's got the power)
And nothing at all (Oh, now)
What a fool believes (I believe she's never gone away)
He sees (Oh)
No wise man has the power (To reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be (Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (Better than nothing)
And nothing at allHoo, my little pretty one, my pretty one
