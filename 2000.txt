Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye

I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on

I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave 
And make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
'Cause you may hate me 
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy 
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Just hit me with the truth
Oh, girl, you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby, come on

I lived for you and me
And now I've really come to see
That life would be much better 
Once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
'Cause you may hate me 
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm givin' up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more (Bye, bye)
I'm checking out and signing off
I don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind

Bye, bye, bye
I don't wanna make it tough (Make it tough)
But I've had enough
And it ain't no lie, bye, bye

I don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
I don't wanna be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy 
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Don't really wanna make it tough 
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough 
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie 
Bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)It's gonna be me
Oooh, yeah

You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind to see
But in the end you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

It's gonna be me
Ooh, yeah

There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see
It's gonna...
It's gonna be me

All that I do
Is not enough for you
Don't wanna lose it
But I'm not like them
When finally
You get to love
Guess what

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be meWhen the visions are around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call
Was standing here all alone

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day when I was through
This I promise you
This I promise you

I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never
Will you hurt anymore?
I give you my words, I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow
Forever has now begun

Just close your eyes each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away
No, till the day when I was through
This I promise you
This I promise you

Over and over I fall
When I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all, oh oh oh

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Oh, till the day when I was through
This I promise you, babe

Just close your eyes each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away
No, every word I say is true
This I promise you

Every word I say is true
This I promise you
Oh, I promise youWell I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a-holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down

You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a-holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

No no no no no no

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

Yeah!

But if I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a-holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

Oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoaIf you're tellin' me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
I know, deep inside you need me
No one else can make it right

Don't you try to hide the secrets
I can see it if your eyes
You said the words without speaking
And I'm gonna make you mine

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life (The time of your life)

I'll give you the time of your life
Oh, baby, yeaheah

Love and passion make me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
Wanna loosen up your feelings
To see what's hiding inside

Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life (The time of your life)

Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby

Ay, que rico
Me pone loca
Como te mueve
Como me toca

Tu movimiento
Tu sentimiento
Si, yo te quiero
Te doy la noche, toda la noche

Ay, vamos!

Give me just one night, just one night, baby
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, just one night (Oh, baby)
I'll give you the time of your life (I'll give you the time of your life)
Give me just one night

A moment to be by your side (A moment to be by your side)
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life (I'll give you the time of your life)

The time of your life
Yeah
Oh, all right, oho
Ooh, yeahIt's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

It's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

What would you do to get to me?
What would say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again
If I hesitate to let you in?

Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off or would you stay, oh

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

I went to you, you went to me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not till I see where this could be
Could be eternity or just a week

You know our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thang and we'll see how it goes, oh

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

See you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first day, what about the next day?

See you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be buggin' on the first day but what about the next day?

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again (yeah yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust if off and try again, try again

'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

It's been a long time
We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

We shouldn't have left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to

New millennium baby
We outThere you are
Lookin' as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you lookin' at me

What you wanna do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare
Baby, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind baby, oh

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if I told you how I feel?
That's just the way
I do my thing

I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timbs, my baggy jeans
My thug appeal
Do you like it when a man can keep it real

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good you make me feel inside
There's not a single question that we can't make this right
'Cause it's you I need every day and night, oh, baby, yeah

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings

Oh, baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energyIt's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The places you need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real

If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeaheah

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one, yeaheaheah

So incredible, the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far

'Cause you know that you got the keys to my heart
'Cause

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the dark night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just till the nick of time

One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me

And four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at oneCome on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Pretend you won't, give me action
You will, you won't
Don't wanna play that game with you baby
So listen to me, baby

In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way

Losing ground

And when I'm down you're there
Pushing me to the top
You're always there

For the will to carry on
For everything you do

For the arms to be my shelter
Through all the rain
For truth that will never change
For someone to lean on

For a heart I can rely on through anything
For the one who I can run to!
Ohoho, ah

For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm) To keep me safe and warm, yeaheah

I turn to youWhat a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Yeah, come on
Oh, yeah

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together
Hmm, while I figured it out, yeah

I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holding hands, making plans
And it's lucky for me, you understand

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for givin' it to me

What I want is what you got
And what you got is what I want

There was a time I was blind I was so confused (Yeah, yeah)
Ran away just to hide it all from you
But, baby, you knew me better
Than I knew myself

They say if you love something let it go (Let it go)
If it comes back it's yours, that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more than

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me, yeah

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
Somebody sensitive, crazy sexy cool like you, yeah
(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
Yes, you got it, it's what I want (Oh yeah!)

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs) It's alright, it's alright
You let a girl know how much you care about her
I swear you're the one who always knew
Oh, you knew, you knew, you knew

Oooh, ohoho, I'm thanking you for being here for me

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms)
Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I need, ohohoho

Oh, baby (Girl wants), oh darling (Girl needs)
Thank you, thank you for giving me what I want
And what I need (Girl wants, girl needs), ohohoho, yeah, yeah!

I turn around, babe, whenever you're not there
Hahaha, oh yeaheah, yeahMay I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat: Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who." "Yeah, but he's so cute though"

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose

"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe"

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' "I don't give a fuck"
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Haha, guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand upMonday night and I feel so low
I count the hours but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice
Can save my soul

City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast and it feels so cold
And I'm all alone (I'm all alone)

Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby, just give me a sign

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (be with you)
Wanna be with you

I can't sleep and I'm up all night
Through these tears, I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand
Can save my life

Don't let me down
Come to me now
I've got to be with you somehow

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (be with you)
Wanna be with you

Don't let me down
Come to me now
I've got to be with you somehow

And now that you're gone
Who am I without you now?
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (be with you)
Wanna be with you

And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (be with you)
Wanna be with you

Just wanna be with you
Just wanna be with you
Just wanna be with you
Just wanna be with youI can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe, just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that wayDoesn't matter

What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you

Be at the mercy of a man
I've never been

I believe that faith has brought us here
And we should be together, babe
But we're not

I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
And I keep my cool but I'm feigning

I try to say goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
I may seem alright and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front, just a front

And I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
I keep my cool but I'm feigning

I try to say goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke
Try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Here is my confession
May I be your possession
Boy I need your touch
Your love, kisses, and such
With all my might I try
But this I can't deny, deny

I play it off but I'm dreaming of you (but I'm dreaming of you, babe)
I'll keep my cool but I'm feigning

I try to say goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not nearHey Mr. DJ, put a record on

Yes I was crashing into love
Of all the words you said to me
About "Life," "The Truth," and "Being Free"
Yeah you sang to me
Oh how you sang to me
Now I live for how you make me feel
So I question all this being real
'Cause I'm not afraid to love
For the first time I'm not afraid to love
This day seems made for you and me
And you show me where I wanna be
Yeah you sang to me
Oh you sang to me

======

All the while
You were in front of me
I never realized
I just can't believe
I didn't see it
In your eyes
I didn't see it
I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it
When you sing to me

How I long
To hear you sing
Beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you
This time I'll see it
In your eyes
I didn't see it
I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it
When you sing to me

Just to think of you live inside of me
I had no idea how this could be
Now I'm crazy for your love
Can't believe I'm crazy for your love
The words you said just sang to me
And you showed me what life needs to be
You sang to me
Oh you sang to me

All the while
You were in front of me
I never realized
I just can't believe
I didn't see it
In your eyes
I didn't see it

To hear you sing
Beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you
This time I'll see it
In your eyes
I didn't see it
I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it!I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth

I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

I would give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you

'Cause without you beside me, I can't survive
I don't want to try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you, oh

See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess
It shows that we were destined to shine

It took the rain to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you

Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude

And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 54-11's on

1 - Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I thought that your love was strong
Till I saw you in another man's arms

2 - No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP
No more dough
We can't even kick it no more

Repeat 2

I saw you on the Ave' and I laughed
In the backseat beeeze spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm having doubts
'Cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you
When I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hanging baguettes around your neck, babe

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 (4x)

No more, I want no more
Baby, I want no more

Repeat 2 till endYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowing inside me like never before
Your love for me something I didn't see
But baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feeling just burst inside
It was only you, nobody else but baby,
I know better now

Don't wanna love you, if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now
But it wouldn't be right if I (if I)
Didn't tell you this tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And now you're back inside my house again
I'm trying deeply to explain
'Cause baby I wanna get it on
And baby, you're the one for me
And now that I have got you all alone
After all this talking on the phone
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong
I'll tell you this is where you belong

(2x Chorus)

There was something in your eyes made me realize
Now I hear voices deep inside telling me, telling me it's you and I

(2x Chorus)Ladies and gents
Turn up this sound system
To the sound of Carlos Santana
And the GMB's
Ghetto blues from the Refugee camp

Oh, Maria Maria
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star

Oh, Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer

See Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said, "See you later."

Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (east coast)
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola
Ahora vengo mama chola (west coast)

Maria Maria
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star

Oh, Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
I said, to the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Mi contar esperanza

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise

Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola

When the wind blows I can feel you
Through the weather and even when we are apart
It still feels like we're together

Maria, yeah
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star

Oh Maria Maria
Oh, she fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar

Put 'em up y'all
Carlos Santana with the Refugee camp
Wyclef
Jerry Wonder
Mr. Santana
GMB
Yo, Carlos, man you're making that guitar cryMan, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood, yeah
'Cause you're so smooth

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

Well, I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave, it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word 
I hear your name calling me out, yeah
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you 'round and 'round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood, yeah
'Cause you're so smooth

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
Yeah

Well, and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it, yeah

Or else forget about it
Oh, or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Oh, let's don't forget about it, yeah
Let's don't forget about it, yeah, oh no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, oh no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, yeah, oh no
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Yeah, yeahMaybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes
I see my future in an instant
And there it goes
I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

(I knew I loved you before I met you) Ooh
(I knew I loved you)
(I knew I loved you before I met you) Ooh
(I knew I loved you)
(I knew I loved you before I met you)
(I knew I loved you) Oh
(I knew I loved you before I met you)
(I knew I loved you)Whoo
Ooh
Oh yeah yeah
Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune, still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

So, I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
Said without you girl, ahh listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl, I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday, you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter summer spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin', ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl, my life is incomplete
That without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything
To hear you say that you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (all the women)
All the expensive cars (all the money)
All of the money don't amount to you (you can have it all)

I can make believe I have everything (just give me my baby)
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete (alright, alright, alight, alright)

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women (I don't have you)
All the expensive cars (I don't have you)
All of the money don't amount to you (it makes me wanna cry)

I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl (without you)
My life is incomplete

Without ya girl
Without ya girl my life
Without you girl
My life my life is incomplete
Without you girl
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah
My life is incomplete

Darkchild yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don'tcha know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you react like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first!

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Then I'd be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl,
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't buy
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Then I'd be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Oh yeah, so many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend.
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay, with me
He wasn't man enough for meSomewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
And now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why
And I don't knowIf tomorrow is Judgement Day
And I'm standin' on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in World War 3
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay if you're comin' with me

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me

As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you babe

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day
Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
I'll be waiting for you after the Judgement Day

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold usAnd if I fall along the way
Pick me up and dust me off
And if I get too tired to make it
Be my breath so I can walk

And if I need some other love, then
Give me more than I can stand
And when my smile gets old and faded
Wait around I'll smile again

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just hold me and then
Oh, just hold me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

And if I couldn't sleep, could you sleep?
Could you paint me better off?
And could you sympathize with my needs?
I know you think I need a lot

I started out clean but I'm jaded
Just phoning it in
Oh, just breaking the skin

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent

Start bending me
It's never enough till I feel all your pieces
Start bending me
Keep bending me until I'm completely broken in

Shouldn't be so complicated
Just touch me and then
Oh, just touch me again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Keep breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me landin' without understanding
Hell, I'd go there again

Can you help me I'm bent?
I'm so scared that I'll never
Get put back together

Yeah, you're breaking me in
And this is how we will end
With you and me bent(So hot, hot)

Of love with you

I was leanin' in the Beamer just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shoppin' spree, ah
And on the way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cash box rang, I thought everything away 

Oops, there goes the dreams we used to say
Oops, there goes the time we spent away
Oops, there goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for it that now
Oops, there goes the house we made a home
Oops, there goes you'll never leave me alone
Oops, for all the lies you told
This is what you owe

Hey, ladies, when your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get ya hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let him know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

While he was braggin'
I was comin' down the hill just a-draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

Oops, there goes the dreams we used to say
Oops, there goes the time we spent away
Oops, there goes the love I had

My nights are long and my days are cold
'Cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now
But I can't let go
Every day, I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you

Driving 'round, thought I saw you pass me
My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me
'Cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
'Cause my loneliness got the best of me
And my heart's so weak

Every day, I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

Like a cold summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom

Creole Lady Marmalade
Ooh yesCome my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So, to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try

Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking, "Could this be real?"
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal

I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so, yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew till I met you

See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, parole, the police files

So, yo
What's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey, sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy

So sexy, almost evil
Talk about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So, butterfly, here is a song
And it's sealed with a kiss and a "Thank you, miss."

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So, come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with meWell I just heard the news today
It seems my life is gonna change

Begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be

I take her by my side
We stand in awe
We've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place

With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love

Only one demand
I hope he's not like me
I hope he understands
That he can take this life
And hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world

Under the sunlight

With arms wide open
Wide openMy tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there they'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you, is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
And then you handed me your towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
And oh, just to be with you is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life

Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you havin' hot flashes

Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'

Expressway, head back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Gisell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Eve:
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now why you grittin' your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to sayin' "Get what you see."
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe?

Huh, sixteen's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach, wishin' I wrote your rhymes

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Eve:
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, block shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor, too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

Gwen Stefani:

(She's a bad, bad girl)Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryin' to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you

Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutterI've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Now here you are walking right through my door

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown, never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I've searched through time
I've always known
That you were there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I've longed for you my love forever


All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
I wonder if I'll ever see you again...Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me

Now I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

There's nothing else to lose
There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world
That can change my mind

There is nothing else
There is nothing else
There is nothing else

I'm desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

Just hanging by a moment (here with you)
Hanging by a moment (here with you)
Hanging by a moment (here with you)
Hanging by a moment here with you(Deejay) Hotline

Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't ever tell me I'll learn, no, no

(Like a calf down on its knees)I got myself a lover
Who loves what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation

Got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
He's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
'Cause when my sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation

'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
Whoo
My thoughts flow in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
Candy

Even though I'm real shy
It's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you
(Indeed I do)

Loverboy come on and love me

Red ZoneIt's gettin' so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds
Or say woe is me instead
There's an achin' inside my head
It's tellin' me I'm better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see
If you will get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I am good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see
Yeah, if you're gonna get some

They say that girl you know she act too tough tough tough

Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you, come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna believe
I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life

It's all in me, yeah

You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that, 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin' a livin' off my brain instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my mama put the whip in my own name now
Damn, shit done changed now
Runnin' credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the man now, in and out my own town
I'm gettin' pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B
Tellin' me about a party up in NYC

Payin' cash, first class, sittin' next to Vanna White (come on)

That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over

It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right, I know it, know it

Don't make me promises
Baby you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life

'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall its now or never

Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at allYeah this one right here goes out to all the baby's mamas, mamas

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

My baby's drama mama don't like me
She doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rip you up, start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you, yee yee

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and yo daughter gots special thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine and if I'm blind, fine
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it, need some knee
Pads, it happened for a reason, one can't be
Mad, so know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school
And graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
(Uh, uh, yeah)
I apologize a trillion times

“Look at the way he treats me”
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
You got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And then you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Talking about jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating, beating, and to the G they be the same thing
So who you be placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Girl, you're my friend when I'm in need, ladyYo, man.
Yo.
Open up, man.
What do you want, man?
My girl just caught me.
You let her catch you?
I don't know how I let this happen.
With who?
The girl next door, you know?
Man...
I don't know what to do.
Say it wasn't you.
Alright...

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you fi grant the woman access to your villa
Trespass and a witness while you up in a your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you're caught up inna

To be a true player, you fi know how fi play
If she say a night, convince her, say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way"

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me when
I told her it wasn't me?

Make sure knows she nuh she really on a right fi vex
A never you she see a make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seeing is believing, so you better change your specs

You know she a go bring up all of the things up from the past
All the little evidence you better know fi mask
Quick pon your answer, know how fi talk
But if she back a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason, it makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost

'Cause I say
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off meIt's been awhile since I could hold my head high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

It's been awhile since I can say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

But everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorryNow that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance?
Five-hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

But tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?(feet?)
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day (light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Tell me did you sail across the sun?

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star?
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?You don't know how you met me
You don't know why
You can't turn around and say goodbye
All you know is when I'm with you,
I make you free
And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you
Want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me.

I'm not worried 'bout the ring you wear
'Cause as long as no one knows then nobody can care
You're feelin' guilty and I'm well aware
But you don't look ashamed and baby I'm not scared
I'm singin'

Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you
Want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me.

Won't give you money
I can't give you the sky
You're better off if you don't ask why
I'm not the reason that you go astray
And we'll be alright if you don't ask me to stay.

Follow me, everything is alright
I'll be the one to tuck you in at night
And if you
Want to leave, I can guarantee
You won't find nobody else like me.

Don't know how you met me

But I got something to tell ya, listen

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while

See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

But you remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through (oh no no no)
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone but me
This is why we could never be

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa

You remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (gotta let you go)

This is why I just can't get with youI think I've already lost you (lost you)
I think you're already gone (gone)
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need
This in my life and
I think I'm scared
I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home
Oh, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
And I bet you need
More than you mind

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need
This in my life
I think I'm just scared
That I know too much
I can't relate and that's a problem I'm feeling

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move, yeah
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home
Aw, come home
There's a little bit of something me in everything in you

I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need (need)
This in my life and
And I think I'm scared
Do I talk too much?
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing

If you're gone
Then maybe it's time to come home
Well, there's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
Yeah, well if you're gone
Hell, baby you need to come home
Oh, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

Something me

You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had (All you had)
And though my heart is beatin' for ya

I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way
And still I stay

But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you're wanna do me wrong (Do me wrong)
See, when I'm home, I'm all alone
And you are always gone (Always gone)
And boy, you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears
After all these years

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

(Ohh)
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies (Ladies)
Feel me, come on, sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to 'preciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Lookin' out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
There's somethin' always hold me backUh huh
Life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh

Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be

I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me

Tell me

I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else 
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break 
And you take what you get and you turn it into 
Honesty, promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not foolin' anyone 
When you become

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

Someone told me love would all save us
But how can that be? Look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood spilling
That world never came

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away, ah-hah

Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

And they're watchin' us (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away

They're watchin' us (Watching us)

They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoaHello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
It feels like forever

Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh, I remember

When you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant

It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes

'Cause when you are with me I'm free
I'm careless
I believe
Above all the others we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
My sacrifice

I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

My sacrificeWhere's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closetObie Trice:
Obie Trice - real name, no gimmicks.

Eminem:
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back, back?
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you Debbie"

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells "bitch"

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

"Testing, attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

KidsLet me be your hero. (Whisper) 

Would you dance
if I asked you to dance?
Would you run
And never look back?
Would you cry
If you saw me cryin'?
And would you save my soul tonight?

If I touched your lips?
Would you laugh?

I'm not always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), but I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my all, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby, you know the game and love is about pain

So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me

I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in Gucci shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care 

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a "Dear Ja" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather

Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy

I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-Wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered

Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm feelin' like ya livin' a double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time 
Checkin' for one time

You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me, baby
I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious

And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call,  I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby, be mine

Here at W-I and Z we play nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da motha fuckin hits...Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to beHey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best
Try everything you can
And don't you worry what they tell themselves
When you're away

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all right, all right

Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own (On your own)
So don't buy in
Live right now
Yeah, just be yourself
It doesn't matter if it's good enough (Good enough)
For someone else

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all right, all right

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all right, all right

Whoo

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out (Feel left out)
Or looked down on
Just do your best (Just do your best)
Do everything you can (Do everything you can)
And don't you worry what their bitter hearts (Bitter hearts)
Are gonna say

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all right, all right

It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all rightWhat if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Everything changes but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreaming, but till I awake
Can't we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this

Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss

Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Oh, like this (moment like this)
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Oh, like thisThis is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, "You make me sick"
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct

Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know

Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothing's gonna tear us apart, promise(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matterY'all ready fo' me?

Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience
I'm lookin' for the right time to shoot my steam
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys

Then, um, I'm leavin' please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check in, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, rooftop, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve and no teasin'

I need you to get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for

And can't nobody stop the juice, so baby, tell me, what's the use?

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles?
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sportscars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be down, I do a hundred, top down and goggles

Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause baby I can't talk it

Warm, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank-top on at this point
You're with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun

So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dancin' in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, girl, I think my ass gettin' big

It's gettin' hot in herre (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin' so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

OhNever made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick inside without a sense of feelin'
And this is how you remind me

This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handin' you a heart worth breakin'

And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet? Yet? Yet? No, no
Yet? Yet? Yet? No, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handin' you a heart worth breakin'

And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

Yet? Yet? Yet? No, no

Yet? Yet? Are we havin' fun yet?

(Five words in my head)
Yet? Yet? No, noHey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

I'm the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Takin' it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin

Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass
So you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby

Jump on the stage watch me going crazy
After wit' myself and one of them gorgeous lady
There is no need to be acting shady
C'mon baby, hey hey baby

When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Now, if now maybe

I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys get the girls in the backThere's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like
No one else
And behind your dark glasses you're 
You're somethin' else

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad 

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

So many moons that we have seen
Stumblin' back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charming
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be...

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely 

And you're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely

Underneath it all
Underneath it all
Underneath it all
Underneath it all(P. Diddy)
Yeah, Yeah
I need a, I want a

(Usher)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life

(P. Diddy)
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's cause
Most of these girls be confusin me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Here's the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
Cause you was depressed and now you abusin me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know 'bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

(P. Diddy and Usher)
Now let's ride...

(Chorus: Usher)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

(Loon)
Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hoodrat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm gettin' money and the game gettin' deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been lookin' for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
It's 'cause of you girl, now I understand life

(Loon and Usher)
I need a girl...

(Chorus: Usher)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

(P. Diddy)
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Quarter K's, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's smile
This shit is wild
All dem days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss dem pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

(Chorus: Usher)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine oh mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life[Ginuwine] Ooh ooh ooh!
[P. Diddy] Yeah, this that bounce right here
[Ginuwine] Come On Now!
[P. Diddy] Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now straight to the top now

(Ginuwine and Mario Winans)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

(Verse 1: P. Diddy)
Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again
Go 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mommy make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

(Chorus: Ginuwine, Mario Winans & P. Diddy)
What I need
([P. Diddy:] Yeah take that)
Is a pretty woman next to me
([Ginuwine:] A pretty woman yeah baby)
To share the dreams that I Believe
([P. Diddy:] Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family
([Ginuwine:] Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

(Verse 2: Loon)
Listen to me now what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
Cause mommy I've done been around the world, seened alot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin Sean bless it
So why listen to her and start guessin?
Mommy you ain't ready to ride to start dressin
I need a girl receive my mom's blessin
Confession, my love no contestin
I need affection

[P. Diddy] Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!

(Mario Winans)
Girl what the hell is on your mind
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's somethin' leakin in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me, always did agree
That ain't what I need, baby!

(Ginuwine and Mario Winans)
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me
([Mario Winans:] Oh please baby)
To share the dreams that I Believe
([Mario Winans:] I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family
([Ginuwine:] Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

(Verse 3: P. Diddy)
Ay yo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mommy I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever bee to Sandro Pe?
Or seened a brotha play Amando Lay?
Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', do I believe in?
Love you till the day I stop breathin, I love you girl

(Chorus: Ginuwine and Mario Winans)
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me
([Ginuwine:] Standin next to me girl)
To share the dreams that I Believe
([Ginuwine:] When I wake up in the morning)
Maybe we could start a family
([Ginuwine:] I wanna see your pretty face, yeah)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need
([Female singer:] Is that all you want?)
Is a pretty woman next to me
([Female singer:] Made the sacrifice)
To share the dreams that I believe
([Female singer:] And maybe maybe we)
Maybe we could start a family
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need, is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I Believe
Maybe we could start a family
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I needEverything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doin', imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doin', I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us but that's not very far

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Oh, nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away

Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

No
This pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me

Can you take it all, take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to meTell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me 
Why don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm 
Cryin' outside the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' ya babe it's all in the game of love 

Whatever you make it to be
Sunshine set on this cold, lonely sea
So please baby
Try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't sayin' good-bye
It's knockin' down the door of your candy store

It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' ya babe it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

You roll me, control me, console me
Please hold me!
You guide me, divide me into 
Into two

(So please tell me)
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now I'm 
Dying outside the door of your lovin' store
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss now we're up to bat
It little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my baby it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love, it's all in the game of love

Roll me, control, me 
Please hold me

I'm out here on my ownSo lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there, oh
Who can bring me back to you

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go

I'll go wherever you will goYo, after tonight

Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell

Situations will arise
In our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

You don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'ma be all right tonight

Aw, girl
Your face is saying why
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me
Listenin' to friends
Now it's the endin'
Then again, no story can end without it
Damn I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

Gonna boogie tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home
Waiting for love
So tonight
I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party

(Oh yeah
I'm numb)

It's OK, girl
Sick and tired of staying at home
I'm gonna have me some fun
Hey, hey
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's all right
I'm not waiting at home for you
Bye-byeOh, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm-)

Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song

Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm you girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found 
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad, hey

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
(Look at yourself)
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it badMaking my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

It's always times like these 
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me 
'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory

'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd

And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you, oh, oh

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonightA hundred days to make me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

And all the miles that separate
You disappeared and I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

The miles just keep rolling
As the people leave and wave to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

Oho, yeah, yeah

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me

Everything I know
And anywhere I go
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

And when the last one falls
When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

Oh yeahThere's another world inside of me
That you may never see
There's secrets in this life
That I can't hide

Well, somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well, maybe it's too far away
Or maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing
That I could not tell my friends

Now roaming through this darkness
I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone

Maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Everything I am
And everything in me
Wants to be the one
You wanted me to be

I'll never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone, woah

Love me when I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
When I'm goneNew York City 
You are now riding
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me

I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile, I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I gotta ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?

If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers in Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?

And in the bed if I use my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a li'l drink you know a nightcap
And we can go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing

Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya' trying figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

We only humans girl, we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl

Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus?

Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about usGo, go, go, go, go, go
Go, shorty

We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub

I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck

But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm 'aight)

In the hood, in L.A., they saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold

I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill' out the deal and I'm still in the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go (okay)

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex I, ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed (rubbed)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my jaws get to bumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

I'm-a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs

So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, nigga
In the club all the time, nigga, it's about to pop off, nigga
G-UnitGet Rich or Die tryin'

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me

Now shorty she in da club, she's dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later had her ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in they ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform while she in the bed
Bitches that try catch a date and come and play the kid

Head full of hair bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne, and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you need some one, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I could solve them, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't about shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms you can't see

Shorty I told you fools before, I stay with the twos

I holla at a hoe till I got a bitch confused
She got on payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for Chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this ho, you could have her when I'm done I ain't gonna keep her

They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand

One thing leading to another let the party begin

(Chorus: Chingy) + (Girl)
(Whatchu doin'?) Nothing chillin' at the Holidae In
(Who you wit?) Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?) Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

(Verse 1: Chingy)
Peeps called me up {*phone ring*} said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor its already eight shawties
I'm on my way (way) let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Road
I'm already blowed, hit third I'm a be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet look like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like wassup
I told 'em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said ain't you that boy that be on BET?
Yeah that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste
There's some pretty girls in herre, I heard 'em whispering
Talking bout that's that dude that sing 'Right Thurr' keep listenin
I ain't come to talk (talk) I ain't come to sit (sit)
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon hit awww shit

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 2: Chingy)
Ma showed up like what's the hold up?
Man know what get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin'
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, actin' silly
The girl said can I be in yo video I'm like yeah!, oh really?
Now she naked stripteasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told OG, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wildin
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin' like they from an island

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Verse 3: Ludacris)
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy)

(Outro: Snoop Dogg)
Yeah, let the party begin, bitch

Oh wee, and light that sticky icky
And we gone do the damn thing

I like the way you look in them pants, shit, ya fine (Fine)
Lil momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (Dime)
The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (Grind)
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine

Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch her 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit

I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swoop on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gon' be famous today

I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walkin', let down your hurr (Let down your hurr)

She stay in the club (Club), like to be seen, she got it, honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah) stop the press when she pass (yeah)

All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Do what you doDon't look at me

Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone, left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is?

'Cause you are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no, no
'Cause you are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeaheah, yeaheah!)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine!)
And tomorrow we might awake on the other side

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today

Ooh no, ooh
Yeaheah
Don't you bring me down today, heyey
Don't you bring me down todayWhen the world wasn't upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait
When a moment can vanish so fast
'Cause every kiss
Is a kiss you can never get back

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here
Holding back what I'm trying to say

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right

Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night

This is the night where we capture forever
And all our tomorrows begin
After tonight
We will never be lonely again

Lift me up
In your eyes
If you told me that is what Heaven is
Well, you'd be right

Hold me close
To your heart
I would go with you to the ends of the earth
And we'll fly
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the nightLook, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man.How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here (There must be something more)
Bring me to life

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life(Fabolous)
Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitta
When the startin lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassin ya
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wonder why he comin' home in the middle of the night
It'll be all right if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be all right c'mon

(Chorus - lil mo)
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

(Fabolous)
You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while on springer
At first you were somethin' I denied
Something I would slide
Just do somethin' in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entre ain't as good without somethin' on the side

(Chrous)

(Fabolous)
Uh oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
It's gonna be a clip toss if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She wont care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with mr. big and r kelly

(Lil mo)
You know I care for you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a lil mo clear for youBaby girl (I really like)
Desert Storm (yeah)

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now
I wanna be more than a friend to you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90s in the 2 thou
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe I speak in general now
But girl, (I'm gonna) do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou
On Fifth Ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I ain't concerned with other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

Come on ma
It's more than a flashing
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashing
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashing
The Drop top 3 in a quarter we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing
The money we oughta be stashing
I make sure every quarter be cashed in

I can't really explain it
My friends be thinking I'm slipping
These girls be thinking I'm tripping
What kinda weed you be smoking
What typa drinks you be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was cripping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxing when you spends
But since you been asking about the friends
How'd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak
Remind me of them trips to Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it ain't because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dipped up deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary NVS dipped Jesus is
Other ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart while the villa being painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it can feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, yeah

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

You ready B? Let's go get 'em...

(Verse 1: Jay-Z)
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin' down the westside (high, way)
Doing what we like to do (our, way)
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

(Verse 2: Jay-Z)
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin' - if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin' this Earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin at Hermes, Burking Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

(Beyoncé)
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (that somebody was me)
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)Love is life and life is living
It's very special

Oh
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah
Baby don't go, baby don't go
Yeah yeah

It's such a shame but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreatin' me
And it's crazy but oh baby
It don't matta whatever do faze me

I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute don't bounce baby, let's talk about this

Well I'm bouncin' and I'm out son 
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good 
Holding down my spot
And I'm good
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

My pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad

The path you chose to run along
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

The nights I've waited up for you
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you

It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me I was creeping all over town 
I thought my tender touch could lock ya down
I knew I had you as cocky as it sounds

The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now (come here)
Stop playing, you gaming
I gotta leave you alone

'Cause I'm good 
Holding down my spot
And I'm good 
Reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good
I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right?

My pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad

The path you chose to run along
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you have a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

People make mistakes, to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely and chill baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homie
Instead a-beefing come hold me, I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce baby, console me, come here

Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now, 
Nothin' will ever be the same
So just be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now

And there's no more to explain to me, ya know
I know ya game, I'm not feelin' what you do (and I'm good)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out son (I'm good) 
I gotta leave you alone, yeah yeah

My pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad

The path you chose to run along
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you have a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

My pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have
You'll be needing me but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad

The path you chose to run along
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you have a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone?

I promise you, you know what I'm sayin'Children grow and women producing
Men go working
Some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

L O X
J. Lo
We off the block this year
Went from a little to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yeah, we're at the airport out decline from the block
Where everybody air-forced-out
With a new white Tee, you fresh
Nothin' phony with us, make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

From In Living Color and movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this headline clips
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you
I really been on Oprah
That's just me
Nothing phone, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
Love my life and my public
Put God first
Then can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while, you know who to blink with
Just keep it real with the ones came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J. Lo
Act like they don't, but they know

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

You were my sun

I already know, I heard it from him
Now there's just no chance, for you and me,
There'll never be

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone

Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry,
Cry me a river
Cry me a river, girl

And all of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it (Yea..)

Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sun shine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sheryl Crow:
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

Sheryl Crow:
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
Kid Rock:
It was the same ole same "how have you been?"
Both:
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

Kid Rock:
You reminded me of brighter days
Sheryl Crow:
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
Kid Rock:
I was off to drink you away

Both:
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I just called to say I love you

('Cause) I need two pair
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(Big boy) stompin' in my Air Force Ones

Nelly:
I like the all-white, high-top, strapped with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, they're dirty, that's why I got 'em
I leave them strapped and laced, they come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em, I damn near shot 'em

Kyjuan:
Now if you look and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip-flop
Yeah my Force Ones in tip-top now form a flip-flops

Ali:
I like the limited edition, the khaki, and army green
Patent leather, pin stripes, you should see how I do the strings
Size 12 with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depends on when and where I'm at

Murphy Lee:
Don't get me wrong, man: Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
'Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some, man
You cannot sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You might not have three or four but you got one, man

10 1/2, and if you got 'em, give me two of those
I can tell she's never seen Murphy Lee befo'
'Cause she just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, "Excuse me, miss, I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you, Murph, especially in the white and blue"
I said, "The white and blue? Sounds nice, make it twice"
Then I signed an autograph, "Thanks for the advice"

Ali:
Yo, I keep it real dirty, dirty, you know how I do
Purple and gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like floppy with ankle socks, lows, mids, and high-tops
With the clear sole but it's Tims and fat laces when is cold
But when the winter go (brr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all-purpose with them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this dough that I'm spendin' fo sho'
On them Nike Air Force N-E behind the O

Kyjuan:
Ok, Lee, I treat my shoes like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and the wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Plus I put a kit on the sole, now I got a wider shoe (ooh)
You see that low misk with the purple coop, I'm driving them
(Kyjuan where you getting them colors, are you dyein' them?)
10 is my size in them, and no point in tyin' them
Ain't no point of trying these on, they know I'm buying them

Nelly:
Now, don't nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them 3 quarters, the lows, they all tight
The only problem, they only good for one night
'Cause once you scuff 'em, you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis, the looks on store owners' faces
This kid is outrageous, he buying 'em by the cases
'Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all-purpose ya heard me kinda like my Dayton's

These Louis Vuitton Ones, you gotta wait on 'em
I had to get them early so I spent mo' cake on 'em

Murphy Lee:
Look, I'm trying to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki, two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wilin') fish bowl in the mall
(I got some 15's) security buying shoes and all

Nelly:
Listen, sometimes I get 'em free and sometimes I gotta pay
Walk in the mall, and they know what I'm 'bout say
Gimme the black, and the platinum, and leather gray
The ones in the back and the pair you got on display

Ali:
Now, in the boxes is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should keep buyin' (keep buyin'), once or twice but never 3 times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell-toes
But can't nothing compare to a fresh, cripsy white pair of that

Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Now lemme see you
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce bounce

Now lemme see youEverybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendships
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You have found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

But for me, it's waking up beside you, yeah
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say "I love you"
At any given time or place

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine, all mine
And it's the flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

You're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy it brings
I'm flying without wingsShake that thing Miss Kana Kana

To take you through the South to show you how we throw dem bowsAll day
Staring at the ceiling makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall

All night
Hearing voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Hold back
Feeling like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me
Talking to myself in public
And dodging glances on the train

And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Hell, they're takin' me away

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me

I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Yeah, how I used to be
How I used to be, yeah
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
(Just a little unwell)
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell
(Just a little unwell)Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, babyBaby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really, really want to catch your eye

Something special 'bout you
I must really like you
Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time

Oh, baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
Cause you are taking over my mind

And it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
I swear, it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

Oh, baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
Doing everything that makes me smile

When we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire

Ooh, baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild

It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)

I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doing to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like, ow, ooh, ooh

Doing more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
Cause did I mention (oh) you 'bout to miss a good thing

And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience
My loving (oh) cause my loving feels like ooh

You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
And I swear it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Oh
Will you ever know it

I might have to just go ahead and call this boy
Hello, can I speak to, to Michael
Oh hey, how you doing
Uh, I feel kinda' silly doin' this, but uh
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids
Yeah
Well, I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday, on your lunch break I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Tell me we gotta use the water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Look man, I mean, I don’t want to waste your time, but
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day
You know, cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean, we could just go across the street to the ark right here
Wait, hold up, my, my cell phone breaking up, hold up
Can you hear me now
Yeah, so what day did you say
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man

And it feels like ooh
Cause you don’t know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
And I swear on my mother and father, it feels like
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Cause you don’t know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday, I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
'Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, I'm messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care
When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, it's your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away

Yeah

On a Monday, I am waiting
And by Tuesday, I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Oh, it seems like I can finally rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh, it's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell

Oh, I love how you can tell
Oh, I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of meAll the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out.

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
Even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah you hurt me but I learned alot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)

Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh)
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) woo woo (woo woo)

Yeah

Now I've got me, myself and I (I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If ya cried a thousand times ladies you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through (After all the rain you'll see the sun come again)I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe

I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out

Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

(Chingy)
It was weird how we met, huh
She was wit her mom in Bank America
I'm wit my son cashin the check
So I asked outta respect (uh)
Would she like to explore the world up high
We can fly in my jet
Her reply was Yes, can I ask you somethin'?
I seen it in her eye, mama lookin' like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (that ain't true) but it was something
About this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual; walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinkin' smart (smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush
To touch, crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk
Conversate about political subjects whatever's thought
So I zoomed off, lookin' by and my phone rang
It was her in the shower, (she said) she said I couldn't do without ya
Then I said...

(Chingy)
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playing ball

Poli Paul
Spencow, baby

Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talking, why not make him wait for you?
(If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you)

Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?

That's when you give it to him good

When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi Lime it up till you fall

Line it up till you spoiled
And have them other chicks throwin', vomit it up
When they can find it up in the mall
Like most men, I like to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle

The best things come to those who wait for it
But I'm-a be straight forward before it's too late for it
But I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow

Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeahSolitaire
There was a man
A lonely man
Who lost his love
Through his indifference

A heart that cared
That went unshared
Until it died
In his silence

And solitaire it the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

Another day
A lonely day
So much to say
That goes unspoken

And through the night
His sleepless nights
His eyes are closed
His heart is broken

And solitaire it the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
She's coming back again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope
Goes up in smoke
Just how it goes
Goes without saying

Solitaire...

And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
Oh, and keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always end the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore,
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to poppin' we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run

While she goin' down I'm breakin down what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's all right
I wonder if a shake comin' with them fries
If so baby can I get 'em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin' on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

Now everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich

Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me

Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'

At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen

No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness

(Intro: Lea, (Lil' Flip))

(Lea) Uh
(Lil' Flip) Yeah
(Lea) Oh, oh, oh, oh baby
(Lil' Flip) Lil' Flipper (Lil' Flipper)
(Lea) Ooh baby
(Lil' Flip) My girl Lea (my girl Lea) hit it

(Chorus: Lea)
Sunshine
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!
I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time (some time)
I can be your sunshine!

(Verse 1: Lil' Flip)
Look, I know you wanna chill wit a player
But all you got to do is keep it real wit a player
Just answer your phone whenever I call
'Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball
I like them short and tall but not too thick
I just walk in the spot and take my pick
And they wanna roll 'cause they like my style
And when I pop my collar I make them smile
I need a lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook cause a nigga like to eat
Spaghetti, shrimp and steak and I'll adore you
I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

(Chorus: Lea)

(Verse 2: Lil' Flip)
I know your friends wanna holla 'cause I got them dollars
Push the Maybach Monday, Tuesday Impala
I switch whips like kicks I'm a balla (I'm a balla)
And if I get your phone number I'm a call ya (I'm a call ya)
And we can meet up the next day and chill
But I'm always on the road baby girl, that's how I live
I got bills to pay, I got moves to make
But when my plane touch down, pick me up at 8:00, don't be late

(Chorus: Lea)

(Verse 3: Lea)
We don't have to be in love (love)
We can just be friends!
I will be right there, beginning to the end!
I can bring my girls (girls), you can bring your friends (friends)
We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end!

(Verse 4: Lil' Flip)
They say love is pain and pain is love
I know ya Momma mad cause you talk to a thug
You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About - what a nigga like me do
I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit Flip
I take private jets to Vagas, man
It's twenty bread each pick 'cause I'm major man
We can cruise the world in a Bently Azure
But don't worry, the chauffeur open the door
You couldn't ask for more 'cause we got it all (we got it all)
Cause you my baby girl right?, right?

(Chorus: Lea)

BLAOW! We ain't got nothin' to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry 'em out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are reckless
Feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace

I pulled up wit a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong

What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm lookin' for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get 'em outta them pants
Take note to the brand new dance, like dis

But where the fuck is the waitress at wit my drinks?

My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door and break 'em in
The owner already pissed 'cause we sorta late
But our time and our clothes gotta coordinate

Most girls lookin' right, some lookin' a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest-ahh

C'mon! we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scurred, show another part of your life

This is another night of these thoughts
Can't get this outta my head, yeah

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

*I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know*

Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

Repeat *

Did he touch you better than me?
Did he watch you fall asleep?
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way
Baby all that I can say
Go on and do your thing
And don't come back to me
(Stay away from me, baby)

(Puffy)
I don't wanna know your whereabouts or how you movin'
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin'
It's been proven, my love you abusin'
I can't understand how a man got you choosin' (yeah)
Undecided I came and provided, my undivided
You came and denied it (why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin' (I know when you lyin')
Don't even do that
I know why you cryin' (stop cryin')
I'm not applyin' no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (c'mon) put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right)
Now it's time you invest in me
'Cause if not then it's best you leave
Holla yeah
Peace

Repeat * *Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times 
But somehow, I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved 
And she will be loved

I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Please don't try so hard to say goodbyeI was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before 
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore...I use to pride myself on bein' the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offerin'
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguin'
From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault again," that's what you're tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointin' fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going, I know they stressing on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya

It's a cold world, and dis is ice
Half a mill' for da charm, nigga, dis is life

Ten years been legit, dey still figure me bad
As a youngin, I was too much to cope with
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me "Cook Coke" shit
Should'a been called Don Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put 'da pieces to da puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoplez was gonna' bubble
Came out da gate on some Flow-Joe shit
Fat nigga with da shotty was "The Logo Kid"

Said my niggaz don't dance
We just pull up our pants and

We gANGSTA, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie
So nevermind how we got in here
Wit' burners 'n hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission
And da bouncers don't check us
And we walk around 'da metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In 'da middle of da dance floor
Reckless; Check it!

I told her to drive over in her new whip
Bring some friends you cool with

Then I want you to strip

Then you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin'
Callin' me Biggie like Shyne home

Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones

She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For the World, she was ready for some action
My dawg said, "You ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong."

I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get it right

Got you lookin' at the gliss, at my hands and wrists
While I'm likely at smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' original like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain' no messin' with Kan-man and Twist

From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy
Twistin A-marie
Try'na Smoke a B
Lookin' properly
Feelin' on a G
And always (well, well, well, well)

Come with me and sip on some regular champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving, so I'm bumpin' a little Spinners

While I'm smokin' On a B
Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got to leave
On the 23's
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let my get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze For Maze
Fulfilling our every sensation, slow jammin', having deep sex

You Ready For the World girl
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controllin' me, I'm lovin' the way you be
Holding me when I been listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.

[Lil John:]
Let's go.

[Usher:]
I'm in the club with my homies
Tryin' to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key
'Cause you know how it feels

I said shawty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' my ear
You would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill

Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow

[Lil John:]
Watch out! 
Watch out!

[Usher:]
She was sayin' "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the flooor
She said "Baby let's go"
When I told her I said.

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea
To take her with me, (with me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now)

Now I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a 1-to-10
She's a certified 20
But that just ain't me, hey

'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty all right with me

The way she getting low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
And I said

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah

[Ludacris:]
Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And Rowl!  These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow

Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris feel cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

[Usher:]
Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah

Take that and rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty goI don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to

What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
It's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart

Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways

Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
'Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name

Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back

What I gotta do now to get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo

You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
I'mma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it been through
Let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me
That I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, ooh

Is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, yeah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my

Confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call

But to give you part two of my confessions

Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it

The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do

Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with

I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said one second baby, please hear me

These are my confessions

But to give you part two of my confessions

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

These are my confessions

My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
