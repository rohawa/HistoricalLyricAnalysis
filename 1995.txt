Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has got to deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
'Cause it's all about the dog in me

I want a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing
'Cause I will be a freak
Until the day until the dawn
And we can (pump, pump)
All through the night to the early morn
Come on and I will take you
Around the hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can (pump, pump)
Any time of day it's all good for me

Boy, you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up
Now there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do

I'm packing all the flavor you need
I got you shook up on your knees
'Cause it's all about the dog in me

I want a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me just for me
If you are that kind of man
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
'Cause we don't give a damn about a thing
'Cause I will be a freak
Until the day until the dawn
And we can (pump, pump)
All through the night to the early morn
Come on and I will take you
Around the hood on a gangsta lean
'Cause we can (pump, pump)
Any time of day it's all good for me

One to the two, the two to the three
Adina do you wanna get freaky wit me?They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day a prince charming would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way it felt when romeo kissed juliette
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance, I can love you like that

I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
Forever's what I mean
Well I am no casanova
But I swear this much is true,
I'll be holding nothing back
When it comes to you
You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes...

I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance, I can love you like that

If you want tenderness
I've got tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
If you want a man
Who will understand
You don't have to look very far

I can love you, girl I can (I can love you love you)
Oh baby oh...
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
I can love you like that
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
Show you you're everything (you're everything to me)
Love you like that
I can make you my world
Move heaven and earth if you were my girl
I would give you my heart
My heart my heart my world
Show you you're everythingThis Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Always, alwaysAnd I...

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl.
I know you put all your trust
In me, I'm sorry I let you down.
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended kneeWe don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say “I love you” no more
Cause saying how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's not wait 'til the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away

Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry (no, no, baby)
We might watch our whole lives pass us by (we might wait our whole lives)
Let's not wait 'til the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait 'til the water runs dry (no, no)
We might watch our whole lives pass us by (oh, pass us by)
Let's not wait 'til the water runs dry (dry)
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, babyBaby baby baby baby
Don't you know that you're so fine
Baby baby baby baby
Think about you all the time

I guess it's time to say baby, baby
How you make me feel
When you come to my mind
I can't keep my cool baby, baby
I can't hold it inside

I can't wait each day just to see you walk
Tryin' to move in close to get to where you are
I'm not trying to be rude baby, baby
Nothing ventured nothing gained
Oh I'm telling you

Words just ain't enough baby, baby
But that's all I can use to state my intentions
Hope it gets to love baby, baby yeah
It's a perfect situation

'Cause we fit together like a hand in glove
Just to be with you is all I'm thinkin' of
Oh oh yeah
What else can I say baby oh baby
We are alone and I'm singing this song to youTo really love a woman

Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears
Stand up and be counted
Don't be ashamed to cry

You gotta be
You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know
Love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Read the books your father read
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time
Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view
My oh my, yeah, eh, eh

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know
Love will save the day

Time ask no questions, it goes on without you
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace
The world keeps on spinning
Can't stop it, if you tried to
The best part is danger staring you in the face

Remember listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Lovers, they may cause you tears
Go ahead release your fears
My oh my, eh, eh, eh

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know
Love will save the day
Yeah, yeah

Got to be bold
Got to be bad
Got to be wise
Do what others say
Got to be hard
Not too, too hard
All I know is love will save the day

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together

And it's not gonna work this timeI've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise
Ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
Cause you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true
You're the perfect find so
Tell me if you want me to
If you thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
Cause you got more appeal
Than any man in this whole world
And baby
I got to know how you feel
Sweetheart
Now it's time to let you know
I don't wanna rush
We should take it slow
Boy, I can love you

(C'mon, c'mon)Excuse me...
Ha ha ha
There we go

I've seen the world
Been to many places
Made lots of friends
Many different races

I've had such fun 'round the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood, woah
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you

Runaway with me my love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lada-mm-dadadeedoo!
Runaway with me my love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines, woah
Under the moon glow down in Mexico I dreamed
One thing was missing, that's you

Runaway with me my love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lada-mm-dadadeedoo!
Runaway with me my love (with our love)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

We'll sail the waters of many colours
Won't need no compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, long as we've got each other
No need to hurry, we've got every day

I want to share the world with you, you see
Springtime in Paris feels so good to me, woah
This is for me and reality so, please...
Make all my wishes come true

Runaway with me my love (with our love)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lada-mm-dadadeedoo!
And I just know we'll have a good time (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (my love)
And I just know we'll have a good time (Yeah)

Oh! (my love) Please come with me! (yeah)
And I just know we'll have a good time (Yeah)
It'll be fun (my love), walkin' in the rain in Spain

And I just know we'll have a good time
(Yeah)
Ooh... didn't quite hit the note
(Yeah)
That wasn't such a good time...

And I just know we'll have a good time (Yeah)
Don't you think so? (Yeah)
I do
And I just know we'll have a good time
(Yeah)Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around (no one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)

Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played (role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye

I've always been in love with you (always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (you know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye

All the world is a stage (world is a stage)
And everyone has their part (has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
(You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say goodbye

Say goodbye (bye bye), say goodbye
Say goodbyeWhen you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a

Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you go into my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a

Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby

It's just a sweet...
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but
I'm not sleeping

Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby (x2)

Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
FantasyAnother day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be, you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone
Alone, all alone, why, alone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Then something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running, darling
And, girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
For you are not alone, for I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone

You are not alone, you are not alone
Said again, you are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
Did you raise for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone
Together, togetherIt's just one of them days, when I wanna be all alone
It's just one of them days, when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone, and you think I treat you wrong

I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave
And baby trust me please

Just one of them days
That a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days
Don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong

Don't take it personal
Baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal

I sit and I think about every thing we do
And I find myself in mysery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really want to be with you the whole way through
But the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back from mood to mood it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me boy
So baby don't you leave

Chorus 2x's

Hook 2x's w/ variations

Don't take it personal baby
Personal baby, personal baby
Personal baby, personal baby
Personal babyThis is how we do it
(This is how we do it)
La la la la 
La la lo lo lo lo oh
(This is how we do it)
La la la la oh

This is how we do it, it's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side

So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

You gotta get your groove on
Before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flava (this is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa

You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because (this is how we do it)
Ooh South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flava (this is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does (this is how we do it)
YNV, SCC,  (this is how we do it) all my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track  (this is how we do it)
Check it out

Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6'8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good

There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
"You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash."

Oh I'm buzzing because  (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does  (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbours you got much flava  (this is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track  (this is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does  (this is how we do it)
Oh it's party time  (this is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the west side  (this is how we do it)

OG's got the flava, yeah  (this is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does it  (this is how we do it)
Come on now, Def Jam, you know what it  (this is how we do it)
This is how we do it (this is how we do it) babyTurn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

But now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
A total eclipse of the heart
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark

A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heartYou remind me of something

Something like my sound, I wanna pump it 
Girl you look just like my cars; I wanna wax it 
And something like my bank account, I wanna spend it babyAnother night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

Just another night, another vision of love
You feel joy, you feel pain, 'cause nothing will be the same
Just another night, it's all that it takes to understand
The difference between lovers and fakes
So baby, I talk, talk, I talk to you
In the night, in your dreams of love so true
I talk, talk, I talk to you
In the night, in your dreams of love so true

In the night, in my dreams, I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same
When the night is gone I'll be alone
Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

Just another night, another dream, another vision of love
With me, I'm here to set you free
I am your lover, your brother, hey sister let me cover
Your body with my love, as with my love in just another
Vision of love that seems to be true
Oh we do all the things that only lovers do
Vision of love that seems to be true
Oh we do all the things that only lovers do

In the night, in my dreams, I'm in love with you
'Cause you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy, I feel pain, 'cause it's still the same

Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

I talk, talk, I talk to you

When the night is gone I'll be alone
Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night, another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of love so true

You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know, that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny,
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
I'm kissed by a rose on the gray
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby, the stranger it feels, yeah
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
And if I should fall, would it all go away?
I've been kissed by a rose on the gray
Baby, I've been kissed by a rose on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny,
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the gray

Now that your rose is in bloom,
A light hits the gloom on the grayGod, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man?

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave, leave, don't leave

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
So try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?

My man...
Are you strong enough? (to be my man...)
Are you strong enough? (to be my man...)
Are you strong enough? (my... man)

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Would you be man enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise, I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leaveMy love, do you ever dream of 
Candy coated raindrops? 
You're the same, my candy rain 

Have you ever loved someone 
So much you thought you'd die? 
Giving so much of yourself 
It seems the only way 
Tell me what you want, and I 
And I will give it to you 
'Cause you are 

My love, do you ever dream of 
Candy coated raindrops? 
You're the same, my candy rain

Look at it now
Might the last time you'll
Have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you'd
Like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route

Don't go too fast
Don't go to slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive
And I like 'em in control

Baby it's yours
All yours
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours
All yours
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

I know that you want me, I can
See it in your eyes
You might as well be honest 
'Cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll 
I'll tell you mine
I'm feeling quite sexy
And I want you for tonight

If I move too fast 
Just let me know

Red light special

Baby it's yoursA lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much

But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little Precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me."

One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Ya'll don't hear me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come On
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days

And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries

My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps em' in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine into your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane
And name this day and time
For fallin' prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fastYou think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, hs a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grin
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

Oh, and you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or whether we are white or copper skin
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind
You can own the earth and still, all you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colours of the windAn old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought, "Well, isn't this nice?"
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A "No Smoking" sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife, hmph
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

And yeah, oh, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you outBone Bone Bone Bone.. Bone.. Bone.. Bone.. Bone.. Bone

Layzie & Krayzie
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroadsSeems like ever since the first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
Can't seem to forget, can't get you out my head
Guess the verdict's in, I'm crazy over you
How can one be down, tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile, I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern, how can I get with you
Till my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do

Chrous:
Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' 'bout you
I must confess, I'm a mess for you
Be sittin' up in my room
Back here thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a thang for you

Pray that you'll invest in my happiness
All it takes is just one simple word from you
Turn my heart around, if I'm making ground
Pretty baby please, tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up
You see I need to know
Tell me if I'm far or, if I'm getting close
I have but one concern, and that one concern is you
Till I'm with you, here's what I'm gonna do

(Repeat Chrous)

How can one be down, tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile, I feel trembles in my heart
I have but one concern, how can I get with you
Till my day comes, here's what I'm gonna do

(Repeat Chrous till fade)There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever

I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember when, no way, no how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allowed 
Baby, baby

If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever

But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me

It's all coming back
It's all coming back to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allowed
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now!

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want
To see all coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me...
Now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And if we...As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talking and where ya walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc'
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kind of G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasing dreams

I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living my life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is going, I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
It's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?You'll say
We've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart

You'll say
The world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

I see you
The only one who knew me
But now your eyes see through me
I guess I was wrong

So what now?
It's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over
But so much is left undone

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

You'll say
That we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart

You'll say
The world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film

And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

And I said, "What about Breakfast at Tiffany's?"
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think we both kind of liked it"
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air (Summer night, summer night)
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say, say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say, say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Mm, yeah
Mm, yeah
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer togetherIf I could reach the stars I'd pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart so you could see the truth
That this love I have inside is everything it seems
But for now I find it's only in my dreams

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could, change the world

If I could be king, even for a day
I'd take you as my queen, I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule this kingdom we have made
Till then I'll be a fool, wishin' for the day

That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the world
Baby, if I could change the worldI step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, ho
Like the deserts miss the rain

And could you be dead
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run

I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I'm back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging round your old address

And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you, ho oh
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
(And I miss you)

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
I guess you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you, yeah
And I miss you
You found some better place
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, and I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeah
Like the deserts miss the rain
The deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, yeahAnd even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame

But if you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

And scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

We grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
Reruns all become our history

A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name

Mmm, mmm
I won't tell 'em your name
Ow

Mmmmmm

I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are; come back down
And I won't tell 'em your nameYeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to his face?
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see?
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets? 

And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

He's tryin' to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

Just tryin' to make His way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to Heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make His way home

Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in RomeOh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up
Yeah
Kut Klose, help me out

(So you say you want me) Now you say you want me girl
(Make up your mind) Ooh make up your mind
( 'Cause I'm not gonna be here for long) I'm not gonna be here for long

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know you want my lovin' baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted over you
(I know I got what you need) I got what you need right here baby

(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do)

Break it on down

You got me twisted thinking about the way that things use to be
When it was you and me girl I was so free, see
You had my heart from the start like Cupid
And I was just down right foolish and stupid

But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at

You got me twisted

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know you want my lovin' baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know, I can make you feel real good if you let me baby
(You got me twisted over you) Girl you got me twisted baby
(I know I got what you need) I got everything you need tonight
(So what you wanna do) What are you gonna do baby

(You know you want my lovin' ) You know you want my lovin' babyI've been watchin' you from afar,
For as long as I can remember.
You're all a real man can need,
And ever asked for
This is love girl.
This is more than a crush, yeah.

It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw ya witcha man
Smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the Coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So I skated off, as you strolled off
Looking at the legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If this love is real, he's got to handle competition
You only knew him 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drink too much, and smoke too many blunts
And I be working out everyday thinking 'bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years, hey lover

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
And I don't wanna violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tounging you down with, huh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs under the moonlight
Searching your body with my tongue girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you'd follow I'll lead
Hey lover

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin my wife no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But it's a fantasy it won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)Los Del Río

We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine

Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

(Do do doop)
(Do do doop do doop da dum)
(Do do doop dum)
(Do do doop do doop da dum) Yes you will

I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way

But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

(I know that you'll be back, boy)
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
(I know that) you'll be right back, baby
Oh baby, believe me, it's only a matter of time, time

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby

And we'll linger on (And we will linger on)

(Do do doop) You and I will always be
(Do do doop do doop da dum)
(Do do doop dum)
(Do do doop do doop da dum)While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears - stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances
But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health
'Til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our heart
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears - stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you were never worth my tearsI feel like I've been blown apart
There are pieces here
I don't know where they go
I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips
I bet you feel a little crazy, but for me
We'll be famous on TV

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it

I jump on you, you jump on me
You push me out and even though you know I love you
I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth

When I kiss your salty lips
You will feel a little crazy, but for me
I'll be famous on TV

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it

Now, will it be my fault if I
Take your love and throw it wide?
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me?
And you will feel you're blown apart
All the pieces there will fit to make you whole
And I know where they go

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it

Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
When I kiss your mouth I want to taste it
Turn you upside down
Don't want to waste itAll right y'all

I wanna know...

You leave without a word, no message, no number
And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder
You left me with a heartache deep inside
Girl you should see me cry all night, and I wonder

Everybody says, what a shame, what is wrong
They don't like the game we play
Heard you're hanging round every night until dawn
I'm waiting for you night and day

Where do you go, my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know

Where do you go, oh oh eh oh
I wanna know, oh oh eh oh
Where do you go, oh oh eh oh...
I wanna know...

Just like a river flowing to the sea
You are running back to me
Come back and save me

Where do you go, My Lovely

Where do you go, oh oh oh...
Where do you go, oh oh oh...
I wanna know

Where do you, where do you go?...

Come back and dry the tears, I cried for you baby
You've gotta stop this heartache deep inside
You've gotta help me make it through the night safely
Come back and save me

Where do you, where do you go...Listen girl you want me but he needs you
Yet you're tellin' me that everything is cool
Tryin' to convince me baby to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way

And keep it on the down low 
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Secret lovers is what you wanna be
While making love to him girl you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I don't wanna miss

And keep it on the down low 
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
And keep it on the down low 
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Comin' by my way drivin' his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

And keep it on the down low 
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know
And keep it on the down low 
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Listen babe I won't whisper a wordGirl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end, it was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should of had my trust in you from the very start darlin'
'Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things that he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby - bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Baby can we meet somewhere and talk about it
Oh baby, can we work it out
I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around
...To fadeYou're the one for me
You can call on me
It's all I want us to be
You're the one for me

I know that you're somebody else's guy
But these feelings I have for you I can't deny
She doesn't treat you the way you want her to
So come on stop frontin' I want to get with you

What you're girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further

You're the 1 (You're the 1 for me)
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (It's all I want us to be)
'Cause you're the one (You're the one for me)

This can be an undercover romance
'Cause I feel that I'm the type of girl
You should give a chance.
Taste and see how good it can be 'cause
You don't have to worry baby

What you're girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further

You're the 1 (You're the 1 for me)
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (It's all I want us to be)
'Cause you're the one (You're the one for me)

So what's my chance I'm willing to do
Anything to get in your pants
You don't have to worry I won't say a thing
And if she finds out I don't know nothing

You're the 1 (You're the 1 for me)
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (It's all I want us to be)
'Cause you're the one (You're the one for me) Repeat 3xI was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there
So was I
In the park, 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chili came to relay that you had a thang for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off
Lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am...

*Chorus* Repeat 2x
Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby bay-ooh-baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

I was like deep in a cool
Whatn't gonn' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly coversations
Had no time for new relation-
Ships
I must admit to you
When I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
This time you have turned me on
Lights off
Lights on
I guess the groove is on, and I am...

Oh, why do I feel the way I do?
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin
On you
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line
That made me fall for you?
Do you know...
Why I'm diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
On you?

Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
Diggin'
On you

And I am...spoken:
Wish I told her how I felt...
Maybe she'd be here right now.
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say?
How could I let my angel get away?
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly, but you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me

I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get?
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know, I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me

Said when the nights are lonely...

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but meGive me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby, I got your number
Oh, and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too many times

You can call me baby
You can call me anytime, but you got to call me

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life

I just want someone to hold me
Oh, and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you
Yes, and give you what you need
I said, this youthful heart can love you
Oh, and give you what you need

But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here
Yes, and I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )
Give me one reason to stay here
Oh, I'll turn right back around (You can see me turnin' )

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby, just give me one reason
Oh, give me just one reason why
Baby, just give me one reason
Oh, give me just one reason why I should stay

Said, I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to sayAll alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa oh
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you...

Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

(Ooh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)

Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby
(Why was I such a fool) (Oh, yeah)
Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me
To find my way home, how could I be so wrong?
(Leaving me all alone) (Whoa)

Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
(Tears will cause an inferno baby)
Romance often fades, why should I take the blame?
(Why should... why should I?)
You were the one who left me neglected
(I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

I...
I gave you all of me (Gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Over you

I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you... (Left me so confused)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (I'm so sorry, baby)
Over you

Yes, I'm sorry
Please forgive me, oh-oh (Whoo!)
Please forgive meEven in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
Quit playin' games

Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh, baby, baby, this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

Baby
Quit playin' games

Nanana...

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Nanana...

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me.
Could you tell me what you see?I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time

Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember the nights
When we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same (It doesn't feel the same)

Remember the warmth of days gone byWhen I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore, oh, oh

All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh, oh, oh
Don't wanna live by myself, by myself anymore, oh
By myself anymore
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, all by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never needed anyoneNo, no, no
No this can't be true

I got this feeling, and I just can't turn it loose
That somebody's been getting next to you
I don't want to walk around knowin' I was your fool
'Cause being the man that I am, I just can't lose my cool

My friends keep telling me about the things that's going on babe
But deep in my heart baby I hope that I'm wrong
Yes I hope I'm wrong but I know it babe

Somebody's sleeping in my bed, my bed baby
Somebody's takin' my place (baby)
Somebody's sleeping in my bed baby
And you know just what I mean, oh oh oh oh oh!

I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something is wrong 'cause its written all over your face
It hurt so bad when I walk through the door
But 'cha know one damn thing baby, I ain't coming back no more
No no no


Now don't try to tell me things are still the same
'Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name
Call out his name

Somebody's sleeping in my bed tonight baby
Somebody's taking Sisqo's place
Somebody's sleeping in my bed baby
Somebody's taking my place, yeah

Girl I want you to know
I gave you money and every li'l thing that you need
I gave you the world (yes I did) 'cause you were my girl (oh yes I did)
But you still ran out on me oh yeah

Said you're sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head ooh
Tell me why, oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why oh why oh why said you're
Sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head
Somebody's takin' my place
Oh yeah

Now if you truly love me (all right)
Then this would not be happenin'
Sleepin' in my bed, messin' with my head
Oh no no no no, gotta let you go

Yes I do, baby babe
Why'd you do it
Why'd you do it
I don't wanna be a fool no moreWhat's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon it would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'...

Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

I often fantasize the stars above are watching you
They know my heart, it speaks to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes I'd pretend I was you and lose control

There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'...

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend

For the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) All those times I said that I love you
(You lied to me) Yes, I tried, yes, I tried
(You lied to me) Even though you know I'd die for you

So I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did, you know, was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

(You lied to me) 'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) But you did, but you do
(You lied to me) All these pains you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) But I do, but I do, do, do

Party people
In the place to be (Uh huh)
It's about that time
For us to (Yeah, uh huh)

Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up
Ride true, a bigger truck
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?
Jig wit it 'cause ship crisp, split it all
Ho's ride, get your nut till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Come on

[1] - Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could

Ah ah
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP to the TV, look greedy
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome VB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just stylishing cars 'cause they all true Nig'
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
One time you had it all I ain't mad at y'all
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy bought
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money
Come on

(Repeat 1)

Ah ah
Do Mase got the ladies?
Do Puff drive Mercedes?
Take hits from the 80's?
But do it sound so crazy?

Well me personally, It's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ass cat
Where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on

'Cause we can't stop
Mason Betha
Yeah
Owwwww, come onI hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe 
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved 
To see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one

I'm a bitch
I'm a lover
I'm a child
I'm a mother
I'm a sinner
I'm a saint
And I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell
I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch
I'm a lover
I'm a child
I'm a mother
I'm a sinner
I'm a saint
And I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell
I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

Just when you think you've got me figured out
The season's already changin'
I think it's cool you do what you do
And don't try to save me

I'm a bitch
I'm a lover
I'm a child
I'm a mother
I'm a sinner
I'm a saint
And I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell
I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

I'm a bitch
I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt
When you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb
I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other wayNo, yes

When you're feeling lost in the night
When you feel your world just ain't right
Call on me, I will be waiting
Count on me, I will be there
Anytime the times get too tough
Anytime your best ain't enough
I'll be the one to make it better
I'll be there to protect you, see you through
I'll be here and there is nothing I won't do

I will cross the ocean for you
I will go and bring you the moon
I will be your hero, your strength
Anything you need
I will be the sun in your sky
I will light your way for all time
I promise you
For you I will, yes

I will shield your heart from the rain
I will let no harm come your way
Oh, these arms will be your shelter
No these arms won't let you down
If there is a mountain to move
I will move that mountain for you
I'm here for you, I'm here forever
I will be your fortress, tall and strong
I'll keep you safe, I'll stand beside you, right or wrong

I will cross the ocean for you (I will cross the ocean)
I will go and bring you the moon (yeah, yeah)
I will be your hero, your strength
Anything you need (And I will be)
I will be the sun in your sky (The sun)
I will light your way for all time
I promise you
For you I will

For you I will
Lay my life on the line
For you I will fight, oh, oh, oh
For you I will die
With every breath, with all my soul
I'll give my world
I'll give it all
Put your faith in me (Put you're faith in me)
And I'll do anything, oh

I will cross the ocean for you (I will cross the ocean)
I will go and bring you the moon
I will be your hero, your strength
Anything you need
I will be the sun in your sky
I will light your way for all time
I promise you (I promise you)
For you I will, I will, I will, I will

I will cross the ocean for you
I will go and bring you the moon
I will be your hero, your strength (Let me be your hero)
Anything you need (Anything you need)
I will be the sun in your sky (Yeah, yeah)
I will light your way for all time
I promise you (I promise you)
For you I will, I will
I promise you
For you I will, ooh-oh, oh, oh, oh
I promise you
For you I, I willI used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an distrustful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, 'cause I believe in you
Oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly...(I can fly,i can fly)
Woo... I can fly
Hmmmmm...fly, fly, flyAnytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola

I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(Oh I oh I)

I'm the kind of person
Who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect
Is what I live for
But a look and then
A smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for

Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction
Of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking
Using symbols, using words
Can be likened
To a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you when
I get to you

Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out
(Oh oh oh I oh oh yeah)
Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a cherry cola

I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Ooh I want you

And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paidWhen I was young I knew everything
She, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stoppin' baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmenI'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break

It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again and I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive

Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the place we used to start

I want something elseDon't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart

Take back that sad word, "goodbye"
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart, my heart, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

Oh, un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused when you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights

Oh, un-break my, un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on

(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me) Can't go on, ooh
(Un-break my)

(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)

(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)

(Say that you love me)
(Say that you love me)
(Tell me you love me)
(Un-break my)
(Fade)This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you

And how you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
What's sad is that I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do
(Should I) Tell my baby bye-bye
(Should I) Do exactly what I feel inside
('Cause I) I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
See what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (ooh baby)
Start a new relationship with you this is what you do
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

You make me wanna
You make me wanna (oh you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (ooh don't baby, don't baby, do things)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (come along with, you make me, you're makin' me)
You make me wanna

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
See what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (ooh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you're makin' me me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you (ooh, you're makin' me)
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me (oh, you make me)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (wanna leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship with youI believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally

Well as far as I can see
You will always be the one
For me
Oh yes you will, boy

And I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down baby
See now I'll always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love, you know I love you boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in boy, oh baby
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside, can't you see
That I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
And love's a miracle
And yes, baby you're my dream come true

I was lost, now I'm free
Oh baby 'cause I believe, I do
Believe in you and me
See I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

Believe in you and meI could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment of treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I wonder what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
And then I'd kiss your eyes and thank God were together
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever, forever and ever

I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing, oh yeah

I don't wanna miss one smile, I don't wanna miss one kiss

I just wanna hold you close, but I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I don't wanna miss a thingNicole:
A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so

You can tell me to my face
Or even on the phone,
You can write it in a letter

The way I'm feeling yeah you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig away to find my own peace of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling yeah it just don't feel right

Shaznay:
You can tell me to my face
You can tell me on the phone
Ooh you can write it in a letter babe
'Cause I really need to know
You can write it in a letter babe
You can write it in a letter babe
Repeat to fadeIt's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, "I'm angry"
Five days since you laughed at me
Saying, "Get that together, come back and see me"

Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish
Although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan

Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits
You try to hold me but I bust through

Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous you'll have to sign a waiver

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, "You're crazy"
Five days since you tackled me
I still got the rug burns on both my knees

It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault, not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watchin' X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison (Dans la maison, la maison, la maison)
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one

Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic
Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films
'Kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a samurai

Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause the cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to your sides and said, "I'm sorry"
Five days since I laughed at you
And said, "You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"

Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say wasabi
Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie— Excuse me. Can I please talk to you for a minute?
— Uh huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
— Yeah, you do too... but um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named... you know his name
— Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
— I just want to let you know that he's mine
— Heh... no no. He's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day, ain't that a shame?

Well, maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All of my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (confused)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it girl, it's true

I think that you should realize
Try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have that you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture?
You're the past and I'm the future
Anyway, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (had about enough)
It's not hard to see (to see)
The boy is mine (that the boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special places in my heart
He was my lover from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine

You need to give it up (you need to give it up)
Had about enough (about enough)
It's not hard to see (it's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up (not yours — but mine)
Had about enough (not yours — but mine)
It's not hard to see (not yours — but mine)
The boy is mine

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mineEvery night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you
Go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that
The heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go
'Till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that
The heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that
My heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on(Sisqo)
Yeah, whoa...

(Sisqo)
1st verse:
Hey mami you know that I like it when you call me papi
But it seems like lately baby that you've been seeing another chico
And baby you know that he can't go down like me
And you know that the nigga can't freak like me
So mami tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me

How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Do you see yourself
Fucking with a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Do you see yourself
Fucking with a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know, see now

Ven aqui little mami
Puerto Rican I see the way you wiggle it
The way you move your body
He can't make it get wetter than me
But I bet he keep telling you he better than me
Ooh you know that he can't go down like me
And you know that he can't go freak like me
So baby tell me one little thing
How deep is you love for me

(Girl)
Ay Nokio
Te extrano mucho
Ven aqui mi papi morenito
Y damelo duro
Damelo papi chulo

Repeat Chorus until fade
Repeat Chorus until fadeThe strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
And emeralds from mountains, the thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth
And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed
And you're my survival, you're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead

And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Well I've dropped out
I've burned up
I've fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in
Turned on
Remembered the things that you said

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
I'll be love's suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

The greatest fan of your lifeI get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears
I'm wonderin if I have to do
Withoutcha
But there's no reason why
I feel asleep late last night
Cryin like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin my arms are yours
I want no one but you
I still remember to the day
In fact is was a 3rd Monday
You came along to be the one for me
Now I'm alone
Sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I'll have the chance
To beg you to stay
I want no one but you
Gonna break it down
Break it down, break it down
Gotta break it down
Break it down, break it down
Whoa
You know
That I know
That I get so lonely thinking of you
Oh-hooh
Noowhoahooo...There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby

When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
Hey it's about you baby
Look deeper inside you baby

I dream about us together again
When I want us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again 'cause

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Together again, ooh) Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh) Makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh) Say it loud and proud
(Together again, ooh) All my love's for you

Always been a true angel to me, now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)
Wrap them around me baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)'

Sometimes hear you whisperin', no more pain
No worries will you ever see now baby
(Ever see my baby)
I'm so happy for my baby
(Happy for my baby)

I dream about us together again
When I want us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again 'cause

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

(Together again, ooh) Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh) That makes me wanna dance
(Together again, ooh) Say it loud and proud
(Together again, ooh) All my love's for you

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget my baby

What I'd give just to hold you close as on earth
In heaven we will be together, baby
(Be together, baby)
Together again my baby
(Together again, my baby)

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on me

Everywhere I go
Every smile I see
I know you are there
Smilin' back at me

Dancin' in moonlight
I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star
Shinin' down on meAh crush ah

See you blowin' me a kiss it doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's goin' on baby
If you see somethin' in my eye, let's not overanalyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

It's raisin' my adrenalin, you're bangin' on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it, baby
Say, "That we're forever more"
That's not what I'm lookin' for, all I can commit to is maybe

So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I'll play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Vanilla skies
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I doBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...
Ooh

I will never find another lover sweeter than you
Sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you

Girl, you are close to me, you're like my mother
Close to me, you're like my father

Feel me, your body
It's your body
It's your body babyYo, remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like 
"Wooo... wooo... wooo..."
Yo, yo, my men and my women, don't forget about the Deen
The Sirat al-Mustaqim, yo
It's about a thing
Yo, yo, yo, if you feel real good, lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you and him then give him a little trim

To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably [fuck] again

Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans, come again

Yo! A-when when come again (yeah yeah)
When when come again (yeah yeah)
My friend come again (yeah yeah)

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only, about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids

But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
Unh unh come again
Yo yo come again
Brethren come again
Sistren come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thingHow do I
Get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?
Oh, I
I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life

And tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Without you
There'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I
Baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything real in my life

And tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?
Please tell me baby, how can I go on?

If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
I need you with me
Baby don't you know that you're everything
Good in my life?

And tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

How do I live without you?You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen... when your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken... when your heart's not open

Mmm... mmm... mmm... if I could melt your heart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
Mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I'd suffer the same
If I lose you... my heart will be broken

Love is a bird... she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen... when your heart's not open

Mmm... mmm... mmm... if I could melt your heart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
Mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen... when your heart's not open

Mmm... mmm... mmm... if I could melt your heart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
Mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key
If I could melt your heart

Mmm... mmm... mmm... we'd never be apart
Mmm... mmm... mmm... give yourself to me
Mmm... mmm... mmm... you... hold... the key
If I could melt your heartZephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light I'm flyingI am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right

'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind

And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love tonightBaby, Baby tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?
Baby, Baby tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? what?
Baby, Baby tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?
Baby, Baby tell me what's up?
Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up?
Huh? Huh?

Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction

I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of getting in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinking.

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

We were chillin, watching your TV
I thought you were coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night, discover I love you

Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Try to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's getting too late
I'm thinking.

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

(If) If you want me
You got to know me
And if you want my love
You gotta win my love

Hey baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me, get to know me
So we can do this

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first nightI wonder if she could tell that I'm hard right know

Hear my cries, hear my call
Lend me your ears, see my fall
See my error, know my faults
Time halts, see my loss

Know I'm lacking, backtracking
Where I met you, pistol packing
Itchy finger, trigger happy
Try to trap me, bad rap

Wiretap me, backstab me
Break the faith, fall from grace
Tell me lies, time flies
Close your eyes, come with me

Come with me
Yeah
Come with me
Uh-huh yeah
Yeah

You said to trust you, you'd never hurt me
Now I'm disgusted, since then adjusted
Certainly you fooled me, ridiculed me
Left me hangin', now shit's boomerangin'

Right back at ya, think long-ranged
Narrow minded, left me blinded
I co-signed it, shit backfired
But I'm bouncin' back, I grinded

Not many would bear the pressure, you comprehend me
You musn't end me, you offend me
It's trauma, feel the drama
Come with me

Yeah
Uh-huh
Heh-heh

Don't be afraid
Yeah

I close my eyes
And I see
You, standing there

Tears, of sorrow

Fuck my enemies, fuck my foes
Damn these hoes, is steppin' on my toes
Back up off me, take your hands off me
Give me room to breathe

I'm not hearin' it, I'm not fearin' it
I'm up to my ears in it, bullshit
I'm destructive, some women find that seductive
Some say it's lunacy, but luckily I've been movin' on

I ignore you, sorry if I call you
I neglect you, don't mean to disrespect you
Can't you see, I love you dearly
And not sincerely, but you annoy me

You can't avoid me, I'm here to stay
Forever, and ever in a day that's never
I can't let you go, I can't forget it
Why you did it, I won't permit it

I won't acquit it, I wanna to fight you
I'll fuckin' bite you, can't stand nobody like you
You can't run, you can't hide
No surprise, close your eyes

Come with meAdia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy let it go

Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
Your friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
I show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love
Be everything that you need

I love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
I will be strong I will be faithful
'Cause I'm counting on

A new beginning
A reason for living
A deeper meaning, yeah

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

And when the stars are shining brightly
In the velvet sky
I'll make a wish, send it to heaven
And make you want to cry

The tears of joy for all the pleasure
And the certainty
That we're surrounded by the comfort
And protection of

The highest powers
In lonely hours
The tears devour you

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Oh can you see it baby?
Don't have to close your eyes
'Cause it's standing right before you
All that you need will surely come, ooh yeah

I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
I'll be your hope, I'll be your love
Be everything that you need

I'll love you more with every breath
Truly, madly, deeply do
Mmm

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna lay like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea
I wanna live like this forever
Until the sky falls down on me

Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeahI do swear
That I'll always be there
I'd give anything, everything
And I will always care
Through weakness and strength
Happiness and sorrow
For better, for worse
I will love you
With every beat of my heart

From this moment
Life has begun
From this moment
You are the one
Right beside you
Is where I belong

From this moment
As long as I live

There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment

From this moment on, mmmLooks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on

You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together still goin' strong

Yo See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all y'all other... out there doin' what I'm doin'
Or tryin' to do what I'm doin' but you can't
'Cause I do what I do my way.
What about you?
Huh? huh?
Come On.

(Usher:)
I Do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say oh oh.
Why is he so fly-y-y?
She beeps me, whenever she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up
'Cause she likes it...

Chorus: Jamie Foxx and Usher
My way, My way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What I say goes, and I'm in control.

(Jermaine Dupri:)
Bad ass senorita's, two seaters with kicks
And new kick's bitch y'all all up in my mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catchin' bricks don't concern me
So forget young midget, My minds on 7 digits
Before I pay heaven's skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pullin' all stops
Knockin' down all spots
Sayin' you can't front on me
So from this day forth you know It's all about me
And what I do be the major league
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like you know, you don't see her like I see her
So she's out the do'.
(Usher and Jermaine Dupri:)
Shot gun in my drop havin' fun with the Don, system, bassing conversation.

Jamie Foxx and Jermaine Dupri:
Baby.

Chorus: Jamie Foxx and Usher
My Way, My Way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way
What I say goes and I'm in control.

(2nd Verse: Usher)
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far then
She had to have every chance that she could get
But you think you a baller
And I ain't gon' call her
Clip that, you can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up
'Cause she likes it...

Chorus: Jamie Foxx and Usher
My Way, My Way.
My Way My Way My Way.
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way.

You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My Way, My Way.
What I say goes and I'm in control.

You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it

Just can't sit
Got to get jiggy wit it
Uh that's it

Now honey, honey come ride
DKNY all up in my eye
You got a Prada bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend, let's spin

Everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid
Wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it

Ill-Way, the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Giving up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo, my cardio its infinite
Ha ha
Big Willie Style's all in it
Gettin' jiggy wit it

Gettin' jiggy wit it

What you want to ball with the kid
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama-uh mama-uh mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, unh

No love for the haters, the haters
Mad, 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali, he told me I'm the greatest

I got the fever for the flavour of a crowd pleaser
DJ play another
From the prince of this show, Your Highness
Only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the west to the east to the north
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off
Ah yes yes y'all and you don't stop
In the winter or the (summertime)
I makes it hot
Gettin' jiggy wit 'em

(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop?
Who else? Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one two fifth

Women used to tease me
Give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezy
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?

Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psyche, kidding you thought I took a spill
But I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me? Don't be silly
Gettin' jiggy wit it

(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it

Whenever you gave me love
And if only you were here

Honestly could it be you and me
Like it was before neither less or more
'Cause when I close my eyes at night
I realize that no one else could ever take your place
I still can feel and it's so unreal
When you're touching me, kisses endlessly
It's just a place in the sun where our love's begun
I miss you, yes I miss you baby, oh yeah

You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around

If I knew how to tell you what's on my mind
(Make you understand)
The I'd always be there right by your side

You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind when you're not around
It's all (It's all)
It's all because of you
You're my sunshine, oh yeah
You're my sunshine
You're my sunshine
Oh yeahWe both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And baby it's killing me
It's killing you
But both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusted me fast asleep
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my hearts not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love you

I know we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Doctor Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending
And you'll never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending

It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my hearts not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love you

Maybe another time, another day
As much as I want to I can't stay
I've made up my mind
There's no turning back
She's been good to be
And she deserves better than that

It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye
And tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion
When you start to cry
I can't let you see
What you mean to me
When my hands are tied
And my hearts not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away
Pretending I don't love youI don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart? 
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not 
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
Oh, to you 

Hey girl (Hey girl)
I don't want you to cry no more inside
Ohh, all the money in the world 
Could never add up to all the love I have inside
I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Ohh, everything I have is for you
You got what I need (You, you, you, you...)
What I need
My love is all that I have to give
All that I have is for you
My love is all...

I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live (I don't think that I can live)
I wish I could give the world to you (I wanna give the world to you)
But love is all I have to give (It's all that I have)

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
To you

Ohh...
All I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you, lady
But love is all I have to give (That's all I got to give)

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live (I don't think that I can live)
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to giveHave you ever loved somebody so much it makes you cry?

You'd do anything to make them understand?

Ooh, have you ever found the one you've dreamed of all your life?
You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to?
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you

Have you ever closed your eyes and dreamed that they were there?
And all you can do is wait for that day when they will care

Have you ever loved somebody so much it makes you cry? (Makes you wanna break down and cry)
Have you ever needed something so bad you can't sleep at night?
Have you ever tried to find the words but they don't come out right?
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever, ever?

What do I gotta say to get to sugar your heart?
To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world 'cause, baby, I can't sleep

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back

I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

I really don't think you're strong enough, noI feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (

Oh, oh, oh
My body's saying, "Let's go"
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is saying, "No"

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (Oh, yeah)
I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come and let me out

The music's playing and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of a light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby

Oh, oh, oh
My body's saying, "Let's go"
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is saying, "No"

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (Ooh)
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come, come, come on and let me outHow did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
That heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken
Oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

This time I swear I'm through
But if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I've cried
This lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things

So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here (How did you)
Standing here (How did you get here?)
No, nobody, no, no, no, no, no (Nobody's supposed to be here)
Oouuuh

Nobody (Nobody, nobody)

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
(No, oh, oh) How did you get here?
Nobody's supposed to be here (Yeah, oh yeah)
I've tried that love thing for the last time (I've tried it over and over, you know)
My heart says no, no (My heart says no, no, no, no)
Nobody's supposed to be here (Nobody's supposed to be here)
But you came along and changed my mind (Came along and you changed)
How did you get here? (I'm not supposed to love you)
Nobody's supposed to be here (I'm not supposed to care anymore)
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Nobody's supposed to be here (No, no, no, no, no, no)
But you came along and changed my mindLately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by

Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by

Have you ever felt a breeze hit your heart
Like the wind was blowing it apart (blowing it apart)
As you're spinning like a merry-go-round
Indications of a storm touching down

I wish that I could weather any storm
But I guess it was a heart break from the norm
Was a day I will always remember
The saddest day in sweet November

Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by
(Watching the days go by, oh)

Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away (sitting away)
Watching the days go by (watching the days go by)

Baby I'm on my knees, praying to God help me please
Bring my baby back, right back to me, mmm
If lovin' you is right, then I don't wanna go wrong
So I drown myself with tears
Sittin' here, singin' another sad love song

Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by

Lately (I've been watching you)
Been thinkin bout you baby
(And everything you do)
Just sittin' away watching the days go by

Lately I've been torn apart
I wish you hadn't broke my heart
I'm missing you babe, missing you everyday
Lately I've been torn apart

'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine

Let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

There's a log on the fire
And it burns like me for you
Tomorrow comes with one desire
To take me away, oh, it's true

It ain't easy to say goodbye
Darling please, don't start to cry
'Cause girl you know I've got to go, oh
And Lord I wish it wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

Tomorrow comes to take me away
I wish that I, that I could stay
But girl you know I've got to go, oh
And Lord I wish wasn't so

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone

Yeah!If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?

Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we
Could possibly
Spend eternity
See that's what you told me
That's what you said

But if you want me
You have to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, babe

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live
With all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you
Trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt
And I don't need the pain

So before I do
Give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
What would you do babe, tell me right now

And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
Don't you lie to me

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me (comfort me)
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby?
Don't you dare lie to me, baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
What would you do if I gave it to you?

And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me babyWhoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me
That's when you came along, you showed me happiness
Baby you are the best, I think you're different from the rest
And I really love you

(If you and I were meant to be, Then you would know, you'll be sure by the end of the song)Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

Hip Hop, marmalade, spic and span
Met you one summer and it all began
Your the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird, jersey 33

When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy

Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macaulay Culkin wasn't Home Alone

Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

Cherry Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make girls smile

Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you because you rock my world
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow

You love hip hop and rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near

You love fun dip and cherry coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

In the summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike

Bugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there, oh, so quick
Let you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it

Like the color purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose

Came in the door said it before
I think I'm over you but I'm really not sure
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so

Summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summerLadies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5.

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna

Beer bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Mambo Number 5!

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doing it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Trumpet!
The trumpet!
Mambo Number 5!

A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

I do all to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky

Mambo Number 5!They say around the way you've asked for me
There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I wanna hear
But that's just talk until you take me there, oh

(Wonderin' if you're ever gonna take me there)
(Tell me what you're feelin' 'cause I need to know)

('Cause I need to know, I need to know)
(Tell me baby girl 'cause I need to know)

Aight, let's go
Jigga

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love

Hey, you gotta bounce to this like this
You almost kinda watching this
Aha
Whooo!
Escape

Ooh your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst
Of you and I can not resist, oh
(Sing the song)

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leave me feelin' blue?
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know are stated
To relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist, oh no

Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Or leave me feelin' blue
Would you go and break my heart? 

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

OK
Cool
Alright
Yo
She wanna shop wit Jay, play box wit Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand a hair longer than hers

She want make love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib
Keys to da newbie
She wanna answer the phone
Tattoo her arm
Last one I got her
Sent it back to her mom

She call me heartbreaker
When we apart it makes her
Wanna piece of paper,
Scribble down 'I hate ya'
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does, and a

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heartYou look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart

And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I have a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type

If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
You and me
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream (I miss your love)
Someday you and me (Mmm, mmm)
Will find ourselves in love again

I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again...Never seen a sun shine like this
Never seen the moon glow like this
Never seen the waterfalls like this
Never seen the lights off like this
Never dug anyone like this
Never had tasty lips to kiss
Never had someone to miss
Never wrote a song quite like this

Fortunate to have you girl, 
I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,
I bless the day that I found you.

Never had room service all night
Never took a trip first class flight
Never had a love affair so tight
I've never felt a feeling so right
Never seen a winter so white
Never had words to recite
Never had a flame to ignite
And I never sang a song with all my might.

Fortunate to have you girl, 
I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,
I bless the day that I found you.

Fortunate to have you girl, 
I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,
I bless the day that I found you.

Silence child hope you hear
I'm callin out to your body
Baby you know just what to do
Close the door no interlude

Fortunate to have you girl, 
I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,
I bless the day that I found you.

Fortunate to have you girl, 
I'm so glad you're in my world,
Just as sure as the sky is blue,
I bless the day that I found you.When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine

I look at you looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm gonna love you boy, you are so fine
Angel of mine

How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow

You came into my life sent from above
When I lost all hope, you showed me love
I'm checkin' for ya boy, you're right on time
Angel of mine

Nothing means more to me than what we share
No one in this whole world can ever compare
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind
Angel of mine

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside, I need to show

You came into my life sent from above (sent from above)
When I lost all hope, you showed me love (oh boy, you showed me love)
I'm checkin' for ya, boy you're right on time (right on time)
Angel of mine (angel of mine)

I never knew I could feel each moment
As if it were new
Every breath that I take, the love that we make
I only share it with you, you, you, you, you

When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine

You came into my life sent from above (came into my life, yeah)
When I lost all hope you showed me love (boy, you showed me love, uh huh)
I'm checkin' for ya, boy you're right on time (but boy you're right on time)
Angel of mine (angel of mine, oh mine)

How you changed my world, you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow

I look at you lookin' at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm checkin' for ya, boy you're right on time
Angel of mineOh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead

I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget, the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I, heard last

Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people, standin' all around
Somethin' warm, flowin' through my eyes
But somehow, I found my baby that night

I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
Hold me darlin', for a little while
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love, that I knew I had missed

Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life, that night

Oh where oh where, can my baby be
The Lord took her, away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world

Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh uh(Puffy)
All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, opposites attract but
We one and the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play witchu, I wanna lay witchu
Stay witchu, pray witchu, grow old and gray witchu
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(R. Kelly II)
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

(Puffy)
I'm that light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair
I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there 'cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, 'cause I simply adore you

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
This one right here goes out to all my sistersShe's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (come on)

Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca

Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on)
Livin' la vida loca (come on)
She's livin' la vida loca

Wooh
Alright

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart 
And she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (come on)

Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca

Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on)
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin' la vida loca

Wooh

She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain (come on)

Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca

Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca (come on)

Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca

Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha

Livin' la vida loca (come on)
Livin' la vida loca (come on)
She's livin' la vida loca

Come on
Livin' la vida loca
Gotta love la vida loca
Gotta, gotta love la vieHere I am
Broken wings
Quiet thoughts
Unspoken dreams
Here I am
Alone again
And I need her now
To hold my hand

She's all, she's all I ever had
She's the air that I breathe
She's all, she's all I ever had

It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I ever need

So much time
So much pain (but)
There's one thing
That still remains (It's the)
The way she cared
The love we shared
And through it all
She's always been there

She's all, she's all I ever had
In a world so cold, so empty
She's all, she's all I ever had

It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever needSpend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh a beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
And maybe empty
Oh and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort hereKiss me, out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken treehouse
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hair
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me

So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss meSomebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead

Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
"All that glitters is gold"
Only shootin' stars break the mold

Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars

Somebody once asked "Could I spare some change for gas?"
"I need to get myself away from this place"
I said "Yep, what a concept"
"I could use a little fuel myself"
"And we could all use a little change"

Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the moldEvery morning there's a halo hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand how to work it out
Once again, as predicted
Left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

(Sugar Ray say) Oh-whoa-oh
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
She always rights the wrongs
She always rights, she always rights
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

Every morning there's a heartache hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

Something so deceiving
When you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
You know I wanna do it again

Oh-whoa-oh
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Oh-whoa-oh
Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

She always rights the wrongs for me, baby
She always rights the wrongs for me

Every morning there's a halo hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)

Every morning
Every morning when I wake up
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
Every morning (Turn me around again)
Every morning
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Every morning (Do it again)
Every morning when I wake up
Every morning
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)
Every morning when I wake upA scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a Busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his on his broke ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

But a scrub is checkin' me but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get with no deadbeat ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your mama
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you

If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no

No (no scrub) scrub (no love)
No (no scrub) scrub (no love) no no
No (no scrub) scrub (no love) no
No (no scrub) scrub (no love) no no

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

See? If you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never risin'
I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the G's to please me
And bounce from here to the coast of overseas

So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget to focus on the picture in front of me
Do it clear as DVD on digital TV screens

Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular and then I'll get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition

Mr. Big Willie, if ya really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly hoe?
Not with T-Boz and all my señoritas
Steppin' on your Filas but you don't hear me though

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at meI wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?

Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you

I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm being stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny

Why do I look to all these things?
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, hey

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you

I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Believe I'm trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too

You can buy your hair if it won't grow

You can buy all the make up

I'll make you feel unpretty too

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up
That MAC can make

But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position to make me feel
So damn unprettyI wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could, cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And, if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand

The angry boy, a bit too insane
I sing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight
You're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well everyone I know has got a reason, to say:

Put the past away

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could, cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And, if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand

Well, he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they are... doing here
And your friends have left you
You've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today

You can put the past away

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could, cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And, if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand
I would understand

(I would understand)

(I would understand)

(Understand)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

Can you put the past away?

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
And I would understand

I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend

I would understandFriday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out
But you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone
Than unhappy

I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week
The phone rings
And then you look at me

You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street
So why did 2-1-3
Show up on your caller ID?

I've been through all of this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around
And take some more

Things are gonna change
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more tears left here
For you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out
You were making a fool of me

It's not right
But it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave

Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right
But it's okay
