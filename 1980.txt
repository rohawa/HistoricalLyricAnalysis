I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life feels so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh, so right?

And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please, love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

Oh, what are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?
What are you thinking of?

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late, I know I was so wrong

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late, I know I was so wrong

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you?
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong

(I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you)
(I know you were right)I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And you don't care for much but I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I've figured it out what I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy, you'll want to carry on (Carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinkin' aloud and I fell out of touch
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan

(Realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me

(Stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me

So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew

She brings joy to me
How can I tell you
What it means to me?

Flow like a lazy river
For an eternity
I've finally found someone
Who believes in me (believes in me)
And I'll never leave (now I've found all I need)

Oh, not to doubt now
Mmm, make life grand

Well, make a wish, baby (make a wish)

You changed my life
You made it right
And I'll be a servant to you
For the rest of my life

You're the biggest part of me
AhhAh... Ah...
We may be big or small or black or white, eternally
And black and white is you and me in a special light
We may be young or old or in between, but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you
If you give it all away,
Make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine
You are desire, everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light

These are the golden years we get to live
We lead the way, tomorrow we can start today
In a special light
Love could be good or bad or in between
But this much I learn
Baby, you and I can learn
In a world that's rearranging it's reality
If you give it all away
Make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine
You are desire, everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light
Ah...
And it's nice to light a fire
When it's cold outside
If you give it all away
Make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine
You are desire, everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your lightLife is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place

I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside
You know we never know why

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong

I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time

We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Live in each other's hearts

We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say

No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
What do I do?

I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
'Cause I know how you feel
What a woman can do

It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again
I am a woman in love
And I'll do anything

To get you into my world
And hold you within
It's a right I'll defend
Over and over again

What'd I do?
What do I do?

What'd I do?
What do I do?Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
That you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the roseWhat's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
"Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?"
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
"Welcome back to the age of jive

Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money"
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
"Can't you tell that it's out of style?"
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?

Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental"
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance

Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers"
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

(Alright, Rico)
Wooh, wooh

Ooh, what's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
"Don't you know that they're out of touch?"
Should I try to be a straight A student?
"If you are then you think too much

Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money"
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to meColor me your color, baby

Call me, call me any, anytimeSeems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low

And the secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

Guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and running to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
I'm still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
Running against the wind, running against the wind
Against the wind
See the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man runin'
Against the wind
He'll be runnin' against the wind
Against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Against the wind
Against the wind
Let the cowboys ride
Against the wind
They'll be ridin' against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Ridin' against the wind
Against the wind
Against the windDo that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you

Oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh baby
Do that to me once again

Pass that by me one more time
Once is never enough for my heart to hear
Oh, tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I've got you near

Say those words again like you just did
Oh baby
Tell it to me once again

Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Woah, do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you

Oh kiss me like you just did
Oh baby
Do that to me once again

Oh baby
Do that to me once again
Oh baby

(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more time
(Do it again) one more timeIt is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the windWell, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be freeLonger than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We'll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years, as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with youI'm coming out

Got to let it show

There's a new me coming out
And I just have to live
And I want to give
I'm completely positive

I think this time around
I am gonna do it

Oh, I'll make it through

The time has come for me
To break out of the shell
I have to shout

Somehow I'll have to make them
Just understand

I'm spreading love
There is no need to fear
And I just feel so good
Every time I hear

Upside down you're turning meSomeone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song?
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart, I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radioWoke up this morning
Dragged myself across the bed
Alice went to wonderland
But I stayed home instead
I started feeling bad
'Cause I was left behind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Oh yes, I'm a wanderer

She climbed right through the mirror
Oh that really blew my mind
I think I'll follow through her rhythm
And her rhyme
I know I'm ready now
It's just a little time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

Slipped down the back stair
On my toes
The out the door
They didn't hear
Now they won't
See me anymore
'Cause I'm can't take
That nine to five life
It's a bore
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

And so it's up and out
And on and off the road
Won't have no troubles
'Cause the whole world
Is my home
No need to worry
'Cause I seldom am alone
'Cause I'm wanderer
I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

Now you may see me
Any time and any place
And you may know me
From the same look
On your face
And I don't know if I could
Change your frame of mind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer...I was sitting all alone, watching people getting off, with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long till we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how it's gonna be

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

No more lonely nights for me, this is how it's gonna be

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyesWell, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' outta tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
But I gotta keep rollin'

Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Well, the truck stop cutie comin' on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride, said I wouldn't be sorry
Oh, but she was just a baby
Well, waitress pour me another cup of coffee
Pop me down, jack me up, shoot me out flyin' down the highway
Lookin' for the morning

Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead slow me down makin' no time
But I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers slappin' outta tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
I gotta keep rollin'

Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day, yeah

Ooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way for meOh, little Jeannie
You got so much love
Little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes 
And give it to the likes of me

Oh, little Jeannie
She got so much love
Little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others 
Who would treat you cruel
And, oh, Jeannie
You were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth

Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast
Searching for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others 
Who would treat you cruel
But, oh, Jeannie
I will always be your fool

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others
And I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie
I'm still in love with you

Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)

Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)

(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new) So in love with youWhenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues and hit the city lights

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance
It's a chain reaction
We'll see the people of the world coming out to dance

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others on a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly
Just give the night
Give me the night

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night

So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others on a ride through paradise
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that starlight look in your eyes
Don't you know we can fly

And if we stay together
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening taking us up high
Never mind the weather
We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light

Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
Give me the night
So give me the nightBaby, look at me and tell me what you see
You ain't seen the best of me yet
Give me time, I'll make you forget the rest
I've got more in me, and you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hand
Don't you know who I am?
Remember my name

(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly (High)
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry

Light up the sky like a flame

Baby, remember my name
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)

Baby hold me tight, 'cause you can make it right
You can shoot me straight to the top
Give me love and take all I got to give
Baby I'll be tough, too much is not enough, no
I can ride your heart till it breaks
Ooh, I got what it takes

Light up the sky like a flame
(Fame) I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my...
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)I spent a lifetime lookin' for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fools game, hopin' to win
Tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Hoping to find a friend and lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

I was alone then, no love in sight
I did everything I could to get me through the night
I don't know where it started or where it might end
I turned to a stranger just like a friend

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

You came knockin' on my heart's door
You're everything I've been looking for

No more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for love

Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces of what I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for loveI love you
Yeah

Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

So please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay

If you leave, at least in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you

So please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay
Hey, hey, hey

Yeah

Babe, I love you so
I, I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

So please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Hey, hey, hey

I need your love
I'm down on my knees
Beggin' please, please, please
Don't go
Don't you hear me, baby?
Don't leave me now
Oh, no, no, no, no
Please don't go
I want you to know
That I, I, I love you so

Please don't leave me, baby
Please don't goEvryone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
"Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun"

"Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man"

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

"Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man"

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'"
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, "This one's for Becky," as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

"I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man"

Everyone considered him the coward of the countyAt seventeen we fell in love
Highschool sweethearts, love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life

I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl when you lose

Ot it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago you were my love

Oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds

(Repeat)

Feeling the pain

Oh it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady

Gotta cool this anger
From this mess that we've made
It's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta cool this anger
Oh I've gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so hot, baby, yes it's so hot
I just can't take it
We were once lovers, we took our vows
Of man and wife, forever, oh
Baby please won't you listen
It hurt me so bad
Well I know I've got to leave
Too hot
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot
It's so so hot baby
We gotta cool this anger
Gotta cool this mess we made
It's so warm
So Warm
It's hot baby, yeah
Gotta run for shade, come on
My baby
Goodbye
Don't cryGirl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance

When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie

You! Yes, you behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy!Ooh, let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm gonna get along
Without you when you're gone-ah?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy? Are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip-ah
To the sound of the beat, look out!

Another one bites the dust-ah
Another one bites the dust-ah

There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad 
And then leave him when he's down, yeah

But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
So, yeah

And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (woo-ooo), it jives (woo-woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

Take a back seat, hitchhike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

Crazy little thing called love (yeah, yeah)
Crazy little thing called love (yeah, yeah)
Crazy little thing called love (yeah, yeah)I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleepin' I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read

"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape"

I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half bad

"Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape"

So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said, "Aw, it's you."
Then we laughed for a moment and I said, "I never knew."

That you like piña coladas and gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for, come with me and escape

If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape

Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tapeBaby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
This is not a one-night stand, baby, yeah
So, let the music take your mind
Ooh, just release and you will find

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Cruise with me, baby
Cruise with me, baby

Cruise
Ooh, ooh, baby, yeah
Oh, baby
Oh, oh, ah, baby
So good to cruise with you, baby
So good to cruise with you, baby
Ooh, yeah, you and me, baby

Oh, baby, let's cruise
Let's flow, let's glide
Ooh-ooh, let's open up, and go inside
And if you want, it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you, baby, oh...
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

You gonna fly away, glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruisin' is made for love
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it...Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
See, nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We'll be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join the fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away

Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the One
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
See, nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn

See, nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
We're jammin', jammin', jam, jam on

You ask me am I happy
Well, as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we've all just made a pact

We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Bet you nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')

Oh-oh-oh, whoa, you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the making)
Baby, babe now
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
No-no, no-no-no
(We're in the middle of the making)
No-no-no, don't babe, nobody, don't do it
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Oh-oh-oh, no, you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')

I bet you if someone approached you yesterday
To tell you that you would be jammin'
You would not believe it
Because you never thought that you would be jammin'

Oh-oh-oh, no, no
(We're in the middle of the making)
Jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Oh, oh
(We're in the middle of the making)
You may as well believe what you are feeling
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's coming from your heartDarling, I know I'm just
Another head on your pillow
If only just tonight, girl
Let me hear you lie just a little

Tell me I'm the only man
That you ever really loved
Honey, take me back
Deep in my memory
A time when it was all
Very right, so very nice
(So very nice) so very nice

Here, darling, stands
Another bandit wanting you
In and out your life
They come and they go, baby

Your days and nights
Like a wheel that turns
Grindin' down a secret part of you
Deep inside your heart
That nobody knows

When you say comfort me
To anyone who approaches
Chalking up the hurt
We live and you learn

Well, we've both lived
Long enough to know
That we'd trade it all right now
For just one minute
Of real love, darling

Real love, hey baby (real love)
I need to believe in (real love)
Real love, baby (real love)
Real love, darling (real love)

When you say comfort me
To anyone who approaches
Chalking up the hurt
You live and we learn

Well, we've both lived
Long enough to know
That we'd trade it all right now
For just one minute
Of real love, darling

Real love, real love
Real love, real love
(Real love) whoa oh (real love)
I need to believe in (real love)
Real love, darling (real love)
Just one minute of (real love)
Real love, baby (real love)
Just one minute of (real love)Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away
Wanna be right here where you are
Until my dying day 

So many have tried, tried to find
A love like yours and mine 

Girl, don't you realize
How you hypnotize?
Make me, love you more each time 

Honey I'll never leave you lonely
Give my love to you only
To you only, to you on - ly 

Honey, you are my shining star.
Don't you go away.
Wanna be right here where you are
Until my dying day. 

Feels so good when we're lying here next to each other,
Lost in love. 

Baby, when we touch, love you so much.
You're all I ever dreamed of. 

Honey I'll never leave you lonely;
Give my love to you only,
To you only, to you only. 

Honey, you are my shining star.
Don't you go away.
Wanna be right here where you are
Until my dying dayWhen I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully
And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy, he's so shy
And he's much too good to let get by
Oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine
He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me

He's so shy (so good lookin'), he's so shy (really got me goin')
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (I'm so glad I got to know him), he's so shy ('cause he's one in a million)
That I'll love him till the day I die
Oh yes I will

He's so shy (that's why I love my baby), he's so shy (you know it's drivin' me crazy)
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (took a long time to know him), he's so shy (and I'm so glad I got to show him)
That I'll love him till the day I die
Oh yes I will

He's so shy
He's so shy
He's so shyIs there nothing I can say, nothing I can do
To change your mind, I'm so in love with you
You're too deep in, you can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house

Ooh, hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Ooh, hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Yeah, baby, I'm crying over you

Don't you know promises were never made to keep?
Just like the night, dissolve in sleep
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue

Ooh, hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Ooh, hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Yeah, the other night, crying
Crying, baby, yeah I'm crying
Yeah I'm like a child
I'm like a child, like a child, like a child
Ooh

You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet Pekingese
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha
Yeah, I was dreaming last night, baby
At night, I was dreaming
You could be mine

I was crying like a child
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
You could be mine, you could be mine
You could be mine, all mine

I come to you so silent in the night
So stealthy, so animal quiet
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha
Yes, you should be mine, mine, ooh

Mmm, yes, you could be mine
Tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armour
Coming to your emotional rescue

You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
You will be mine, you will be mine, all mine
I will be your knight in shining armour
Riding across the desert
On a fine Arab charger

(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha)
(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha)
(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha)
(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ha)It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishin' you were here with me

Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do

If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me, oh

If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me
Oh, baby, you took your love away from
Me

SayonaraOvernight scenes, dinner and wine
Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me oh oh oh

It's such a crazy old town
It can drag you down
Till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't know what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me oh oh oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl

Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine
And together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute
That we're together
And I'll stay right here forever oh oh ohHere I am, playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending
My heart it's not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own, I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without, go on without

Yes, just go on without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)
Without you
(And just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)
Without you
(And just when I thought I could stand on my own)

Without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)
Without you
(And just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you
(Just when I thought I was over you)
(Fade)Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Don't say the morning's come
Don't say the morning's come so soon
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose

Love is everywhere, I know it is
Such moments as this are too few
Oh, it's all up to you
It's all up to you

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay, oh please
They are the words to say
The only words I can believe

Hold me in your arms for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh, we have the right you know
We have the right you know

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

The night has gone, a part of yesterday
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many ways

Here I am, the one that you love
Asking for another day
Understand, the one that you love
Loves you in so many waysShadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on 
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day 
Just a matter of time

And we got nothing to be guilty of 
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end 
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't want to hear your goodbye

Ooh, ooh

Pulses racing, darling
Out where we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark

It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to out in the cold

You battle on with the love you're building on

You got be mine

Don't want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we areToe to toe, dancing very close
Body breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger-popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture

Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinning, I said "My, my"
Flash is fast, flash is cool
François, c'est pas flashé non due
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot

And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes the man from Mars

And you try to run, but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns, too
Mercurys, and Subaru
And you don't stop
You keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars

You go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face
Dance cheek to cheek

One to one
Man to man
Dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow

'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars
Yeah, wall to wall
Door to door
Hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all

Rapture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train
You'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop, do the punk rock

Well, now you see what you want to be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

And you hip hop
And you don't stop
Just blast off
Sure shot

Because the man from Mars stopped eating cars
And eating bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up

Man to man, body muscular
Seismic dancing, move, bite the jugular
One to one, teatime technology
And a digital add-up
No sign of bad luck in raptureThe tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

It's not the things you do that tease and wound me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one

Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear till it's my turn

This is an old Memphis song, old Memphis song

I used to smoke
Five packs of cigarettes a day
It was the hardest thing
To put them away
I drink four or five bottles of wine
I kept a glass
In my hand all the time
Breaking those habits was hard to do
But nothing compared to the changes
You put me through

Trying to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Trying to forget the love we once shared
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bear

All right, I said

I had the worst reputation in town
For chasing all the women around
I thought changing my way of living
Was hard to do
But it's nothing compared to the changes
That you put me through

I've done everything I've tried to do
But it's gonna take a miracle
To get me over you

Trying to live my life without you babe
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
Trying to forget the love we once shared, yeah
It's the hardest burden I'll ever bearGot a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heartOnce in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (the best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (the best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's trueI want you to want me
I'm going crazy knowing he will be your lover tonight
And when he comes, I'll let you go
I'll just pretend as you walk out the door

Oh no
I can't sleep
Oh no
I'm going crazy with love
Over you

I need you to need me
I want to hold you but you're holding someone else in your arms
When I close my eyes I see your face
I'm just not sure how much my heart can erase

Oh no
I can't think, ooh
Oh no
I'm going crazy with love
Over you

Oh, honey
Oh, sugar

Oh no
I can't sleep anymore baby
Oh no

There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I, I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever (ooh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love (oh, love)
I'll be a fool for you, I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind

Because you
You mean the world to me, oh

My endless love

You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside

And I'll give it all to you
My love
My love, my love
My endless loveTumble out of bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life

Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
For folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5
For service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fat promotion

Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me 
I swear sometimes that man is
Out to get me, hmmm

They let you dream
Just a watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away

In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn
And it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind
And you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5
Yeah, they got you were they want you
There's a better life
And you think about it, don't you?

It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

9 to 5
Oh, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5
Yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life
And you dream about it, don't you?

It's a rich man's game
No matter what they call it
And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

9 to 5I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say 'hello'
And though you wished to me well
You couldn't tell

That I'd been
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

Then you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying.
Crying
Crying
Crying

It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I, was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more, than I did before
But, darling, what can I do

While you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
(Crying)
Crying
(Crying)
Crying
(Crying)
Crying over you
Over you
Over youWell, I love a rainy night

Watch the lightning
When it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good

Well, I love a rainy night
It's such a beautiful sight

When she walks by you don't know what to say
You gonna make a move, you better make it now
Don't be afraid, 'cause love will show you how

Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step
Tell her she's the one you're dreaming of
Third step
Take her in your arms and never let her go
Don't you know step by step
Step by step

You wanna fly, don't want your feet on the ground
You stay up, you won't come down
You wanna live, you wanna move to the sound

Got fire in your veins
Burning hot, but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane
You can't stop until you do it again

But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
That's why you call me in the middle of the night

You say it's urgent
So urgent
So urgent, just you wait and see
How urgent my love can be
It's urgent

You play tricks on my mind
You're everywhere, but you're so hard to find
You're not warm or sentimental
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental

But I'm not looking for a love that lasts
I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for each other, anytime, anywhere

It gets so urgent
So urgent
You know it's urgent
I wanna tell you it's the same for me
So urgent, just wait and see
How urgent our love can be
It's urgent

You say urgent
Make it fast, make it urgent
Do it quick, do it urgent
Gotta rush, make it urgent

Want it quick, make it urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, (urgent) urgent (urgent), emergency
Urgent, (urgent) urgent (urgent), emergency
So urgent, emergency

Uh ooh (uh ooh)
Uh ooh (uh ooh)
Uh ooh (uh ooh)I'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
And you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

Talking all 'bout how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
"All you need is love"

Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

All those years ago
All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago

You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

Ooh, all those years ago
Ooh, all those years ago
Ooh, all those years ago
All those years agoLook at what's happened to me
I can't believe it myself
Suddenly I'm up on top of the world
It should've been somebody else

Believe it or not I'm walking on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me

Just like the light of a new day
It hit me from out of the blue
Breaking me out of the spell I was in
Making all of my wishes come true

Believe it or not I'm walking on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me

This is too good to be true
Look at me, fallin' for you

Believe it or not
Believe it or not
Believe it or not
Believe it or not

Believe it or not I'm walking on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me

Believe it or not I'm walking on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me

Believe it or not I'm walking on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just meOur life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere

Starting overWoman I can hardly express
My mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness
After all I'm forever in your debt
And woman I will try to express
My inner feelings and thankfulness
For showing me the meaning of success
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Woman I know you understand
The little child inside the man
Please remember my life is in your hands
And woman hold me close to your heart
However distant don't keep us apart
After all it is written in the stars

Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, well, well
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Wellll

Woman please let me explain
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain
So let me tell you again and again and again

I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeah
Now and forever
I love you, yeah, yeahIt's been a mystery 
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad

Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change their headstrong ways

And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fightin' is worth the love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

Only so many tears you can cry
'Til the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying nowThere'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day
Of the years, baby baby baby

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darlingMidnight, and I'm a-waiting on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line

Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done

Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie,
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you


Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one

And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie,
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of hearts
Playing with the queen of heartsI don't need you
I don't need friendship
I don't need flowers in the spring
I don't need you
And you surely don't need me

I don't need love and affection
I don't peace and harmony
I don't need you
And you surely don't need me

But we both want it bad enough
Yes, we both want it, don't we?
I don't need you baby
And I know you don't need me

I don't need your loving arms around me
All I need is to be free
That's what I keep telling myself
And I tell you, you don't need me

I don't need children in my old age
No more cluttered leaves around the tree
And I don't need you baby
And I know you don't need me

But we both want it bad enough
Yes, we both want it, don't we?
I don't need you baby
And I know you don't need me

And we don't need each other, baby
We don't need each other, baby
Or do we?Lady
I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love
There's so many ways I want to say, "I love you."
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?

Lady
For so many years, I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever
Let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes, I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

Lady
Your love's the only love I need
And beside me is where I want you to be

Her lips sweet surprise

You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo's standoff sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue

Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose
So you just sing the blues
All the time

Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when your love's on the rocks

First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you my lies
Yesterday's gone
And now all I want is a smileYou should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen

You played dead
Ah, but you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'

And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before then
And we're still together

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you, I meant
That I'd love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving you

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you, I meant
That I'd love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving you

Baby, I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving youHeard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' around
They say you got a boyfriend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down 

But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheaper when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm telling you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is, keep this in mind 

You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run 

You're thinking up your white lies
You're putting on your bedroom eyes
You say you're coming home, but you won't say when
But I can feel it coming
If you leave tonight, keep running
And you need never look back again 

You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run

Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run

Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun 
So you take it on the run

Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' aroundJessie is a friend
Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed
It ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

I'll play along with this charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her but the point is probably moot
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?

Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman?
Why can't I find a woman like that?

And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?
Tell me why can't I find a woman like that?

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Why can't I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girlSomebody somewhere
In the heat of the night
Looking pretty dangerous
Running out of patience

Tonight in the city
You won't find any pity
Hearts are being twisted
Another lover cheated, cheated

In the bars and the cafes, passion
In the streets and the alleys, passion

Everybody searching, passion

One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Passion, passion

Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah

Alone in your bed at night, passion
It's half past midnight, passion
As you turn out your sidelight, passion
Something ain't right, passion

There's no passion, there's no passion
There's no passion, I need passion
You need passion, We need passion
Can't live without passion
Won't live without passion
Can't live without passion

Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion

PassionWell, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me.

Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no.

Don't you know you can tell everyone that we're through
You might even believe it too
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down
So you can walk out on me tonight.

If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
You'll see sweet darling, there's ain't no getting over me
No, no, no, no, No Darling, there ain't no getting over me.

Ooh mmmm
Mmmm No darling, there ain't no getting over me.

Ooh darling, there ain't no getting over me...For your eyes only, can see me through the night
For your eyes only, I never need to hide
You can see so much in me
So much in me that's new
I never felt, until I looked at you

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The love I know you need in me
The fantasy you freed in me
Only for you, only for you

For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The passions that collide in me
The wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes onlyI wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine to five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
(He works from nine to five and then)
(He takes another home again)
(To find me waitin' for him)I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say "we told you so"
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go

I've heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say, no
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you

People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
Being with you
Being with you

I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
I wanna be with you
I don't care if they start to avoid meTonight's the night we'll make history, honey, you and I
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time
And stay with you here tonight
I know you feel these are the worst of times
I do believe it's true
When people lock their doors and hide inside
Rumor has it it's the end of Paradise
But I know, if the world just passed us by
Baby I know, I wouldn't have to cry

The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find these are the best of times
These are the best of times

The headlines read 'these are the worst of times'
I do believe it's true
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide
I wish the summer winds could bring back Paradise
But I know, if the world turned upside down
Baby, I know you'd always be around

The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find these are the best of times
These are the best of times

And 
So my friends we'll say goodnight For time has claimed its prize
But tonight will always last
As long as we keep alive memories of Paradise...Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira.

Eyes that look like heaven, lips like cherry wine
That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine
'Cause I know that my Elvira's mine.
So I'm singin'

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
High-o Silver, away.

Tonight I'm gonna meet her at the Hungry House Cafe
I'm gonna give her all the love I can, yes I am.
She's gonna jump and holler
'Cause I've saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man.
And I'm singin'

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
High-o Silver, away.

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for ElviraAs the midnight moon was drifting through 
The lazy sway of the trees 
I saw the look in your eyes looking into mine 
Seeing what you wanted to see 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard 
What your body's saying to mine 
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind 

I want a man with a slow hand 
I want a lover with an easy touch 
I want somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love I want a slow hand

On shadowed ground with no one around 
And a blanket of stars in our eyes 
We are drifting free, like two lost leaves 
On the crazy wind of the night 
Darlin' don't say a word 'cause I already heard 
What your body's saying to mine 
If I want it all night, you say it's alright 
We got the time

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I've found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I've found somebody who will understand 
When it comes to love I want a slow hand 

If I want it all night,
Please say it's alright 
It's not a fast move but a slow groove 
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand 
I got a lover with an easy touch 
I've found somebody who will spend some time 
Not come and go in a heated rush 
I've found somebody who will understand 
I've found a lover with a slow hand

Ooh, lover with a slow hand
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I've found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush

Ooh, lover with a slow handThough I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old-fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

On and
On and
On and

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic

Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh
Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh
Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh
Eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh, eee oh-oh

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing she do is magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ma-oh
Yo-oh
Eee-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Ooh-oh
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
Getting wetIf you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop

I've been running hot
You got me ticking gonna blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop, never stop, never stop, never stop

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk in smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start it up
Kick on the starter give it all you got, you got, you got
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slide it up, slide it up, slide it up, slide it up

Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy
She's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start me up
Give it all you got
You got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up
Slide it up
Slide it up (never, never, never)

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

Start it up
Love the day when we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come
You, you make a dead man comeI, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

(Guitar Instrumental)

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh

Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
(Fade)This is the time when you need a friend
You just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night
I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here

How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do?
Always denied the right to live my life the way
I want, I want to share it with you

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
But what I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home

There's not much time to tell you
Half the things that I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me
I keep for these moments, whoa, oh oh oh ooh

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreamsI never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidence arose from circumstance?
One thing led to another we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling you what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in '82
The disco hotspots hold no charm for you
You can't concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone?
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you'll remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling you what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

It was the heat of the moment
The heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment...Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife

I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

Ooohooo, I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun

But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Please, lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today

I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

Oh, I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlo in Monte Carlo
And showed them what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places as we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet

I've spent my life exploring, the subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free, hey, lady
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

I've been to paradise
Never been to me

I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

Been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I've sipped champange on a yacht
I've been to paradise
Never been to to meWanna see you whip it

Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time
There's nobody in the future
So, baby, let me hand you my love
Oh, no step for you to dance to 
So slip your hand inside my glove

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me

I don't want no damage
But how am I gonna manage you?
You want a percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues
I live just around the corner
If you've got a minute to spare
I'll be waiting for you
If you ever want to be there

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Why won't you) Hold me, hold me, hold me?

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold meSo long
I've been looking too hard, I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone

It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too

Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I wanna be sure

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you (waiting for a love)
And a love that will survive
I've been waiting (I've been waiting) for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting for a girl like you (waiting for a girl)
To come into my life

You're so good
When we make love, it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone

Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you (waiting for a love)
For a love that will survive

I've been waiting (I've been waiting) for someone new
To make me feel alive
Yeah, waiting (waiting) for a girl like you (waiting for a girl)

(I've been waiting) Won't you come into my life?
My life
So long (Waiting for a girl like you)You've got the love
You've got the power
But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour
For your love

I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believe in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love

I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around

Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
Oh, don't you let the lady take it
All away
When the woman needs
A taste of yesterday
But you stay at home
All they get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around

Oh, girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me
We're gonna make it
You're gonna take it
Back where we belong

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)

Turn your love around
This time the girl became a woman
Don't you turn me down
Every woman needs a man
I can show you how
I love the girl
I love the woman
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)

Turn your love around
This time the girl became a woman
Don't you turn me down
Every woman needs a man
I can show you how
I love the girl
I love the woman
Turn your love around
(Turn your love around)

Turn your love around
This time the girl became a woman
Don't you turn me down
Every woman needs a man
I can show you howWho knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blow

Some hang on to "used to be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb them a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belongWhen I was a young boy
Said put away those young boy ways
Now that I'm gettin' older, so much older
I long for those young boy days

With a girl like you
With a girl like you
Lord knows there are things we can do, baby
Just me and you
Come on and make it, uh

Hurt so good
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

Don't have to be so excitin'
Just tryin' to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah
You always look so invitin'
You ain't as green as you are young

Hey baby, it's you
Come on, girl, now, it's you
Sink your teeth right through my bones, baby
Let's see what we can do
Come on and make it, uh

Hurt so good
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

I ain't talkin' no big deals
I ain't made no plans myself
I ain't talkin' no high heels
Maybe we could walk around all day long
Walk around all day long
Uh

Hurt so good
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good

Hurt so good (come on baby, now)
Come on baby, make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
You make it hurt so good
Eh, ehA little titty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jackie gonna be a football star
Diane's a debutante, backseat of Jackie's car

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee-Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jackie's lap
He's got his hands between her knees
Jackie say, "Hey Diane, let's run off behind the shady trees
Dribble off those Bobbie Brooks, let me do what I please."
And say uh

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they say uh
Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they walk on

Jackie sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then there Diane, we oughta run off to the city."
Diane says, "Baby, you ain't missin' nothing."
And Jackie say uh

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

Gonna let it rock
Let it roll
Let the Bible Belt come and save my soul
Hold on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah, they say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

A little titty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they canLying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, "You're so sincere"
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together 
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms 

Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back 
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say

Whispering the words, "I'll always love you."

And forever
I will be your lover

Now, I need to tell you this
There's no other love like your love
And I, as long as I live

And truly
You know you're alright with meShe's so very nice you should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
Whatcha tryin' to hide when you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find?
Ah, can't you see it?
Don't you think she's feeling the same?
Ah, I guarantee it,
She's the one that's calling your name

You should hear how she talks about you,

She just can't get enough.
She says she would be lost without you,
She is really in love.

She is really in love.Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go away, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired and I'm not feeling right

All I wish is to be alone
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip toe across the floor
If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped and here I'll have to stay

I've done no harm, I keep to myself
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend
Here they come, those feelings again

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Is it the men come to take me away?
Why do they follow me?
It's not the future that I can see
It's just my fantasy, yeah

Oh, who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it? Who can it?
Who can it be now?Come back again
I want you to stay next time
Cause sometimes the world ain't kind
When people get lost like you... and me

I just made a friend
A friend is someone you need
But now that he had to go away
I still feel the words that he might say

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see
Turn on your heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon... you and me

He's lookin' for a home
Cause everyone needs a place
And home's the most excellent place of all
And I'll be right here if you... should... call... me

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see
Turn on your heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon... you and me

And home's the most excellent place of all
And I'll be right here if you... should... call... me

Turn on your heartlight
Let it shine wherever you go
Let it make a happy glow
For all the world to see
Turn on your heartlight
In the middle of a young boy's dream
Don't wake me up too soon
Gonna take a ride across the moon... you and me

Turn on your heartlight now
Turn on your heartlight nowMy mouth is dry
My legs are weak
I'm thinking this 'cause I can't speak
I'm looking at you
You're looking at me
You must think that I'm just crazy

If you only knew
What you're putting me through
Feels like
A heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack

Must have died and gone to heaven
What a way to go

I can't catch my breath
It must be a dream
But you're the cutest thing I've ever seen
I'm way past the point
Of recovery
You're gonna be the death of me

If you only knew
What you're putting me through
Feels like
A heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack

Must have died and gone to heaven
What a way to go

Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attack
Heart attack
You're givin' me a heart attackI can tell you got plans for me
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully
But tonight I have to say there just might be another way
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms
I can't wait, I can't wait

I'm the one you want, that's all I wanna be
So come on baby make a move on me
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free
So come on baby make a move on me tonight
I can't wait, I can't wait

You made the prettiest speech I've heard
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words
To a heart that's open wide and from the start was on your side
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms
I can't wait, I can't wait

I'm the one you want, that's all I wanna be
So come on baby make a move on me
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free

Making good conversation

You know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie
There's nothing left to talk about
Unless it's horizontally

Tried to keep my hands on the table

We know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out
The animal in me

I swear I'll never, ever wait again
You gave me your word, but words for you are lies

Darling, in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

All of my life, I've been waitin' in the rain
I've been waitin' for a feeling that never, ever came
It feels so close but always disappears

Darlin', in your wildest dreams
You never had a clue
But it's time you got the news

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

Darlin', in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

I'm a-gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm a-gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears

Harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
No, oh, oh, oh
Harden my heart

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Aw shucks, I'm just the average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl who's love was so tough
Who'd a thought a one night stand
Could turn into such a hot romance
Mm, when she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Now I know the rules of the games
You hit it once then break away clean
I should have never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more
My friends laugh but that's alright
I may be a fool but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Somebody help me
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Oh this affair is unique
All my life I never met such a freak
She keeps me goin' strong for so long
When I get home it's all gone
Makes me wanna grab my guitar
And play with it all night long

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Tell me, has anybody else out there
Ever fell in love with the other woman
Oh with the other woman
Say I'm in love with the other woman
With the other woman, with the other woman
I'm in love, sure 'nough in loveWhen you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories; I don't think that's cool

Why don'tcha tell me someone isn't lovin' you?
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don'tcha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

Now tell me, how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough; baby, that's a pity
And every man's an actor; every girl is pretty
I don't like what's gettin' back to me

Now, who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of?
Love hurts when only one's in love
Now, did ya fall at first sight or did you need a shove?
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don'tcha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

(Fais l'amour avec moi)
What's he sayin', baby?
(Viens dormir, mon amour)
I asked you not to talk to him
(Je t'aime donne moi ton cœur se soir)
I'm begging you

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don'tcha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don'tcha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don'tcha
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, don'tcha talk
(Don't talk to strangers...)Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket and a head full of dreams
He said somehow, someway, it's gotta get better than this
Patty packed her bags, left a note for her mama, she was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night, they were so excited
We got but one shot at life, let's take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief, and time is a thief when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Paradise was closed, so they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a two-room apartment that was jumping every night of the week
Happiness was found in each other's arms, as expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears, drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Come on, man

Whoo

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on, on your side

Billy wrote a letter back home to Patty's parents, trying to explain
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody listening, so we just ran away
Patty gave birth to a 10-pound baby boy, yeah

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Young hearts gotta learn
Time is on, yeah, time is on your side
Time, time, time, time is on your side, is on your side, is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-oohThat girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart

She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart

That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears from joy to sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
'Cause she can please her man

She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl, That girl

That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

That's why I know I'll tell that I love her
That I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

Tell her I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

That I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to...

Tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her...

That girl, that girl, that girl,
Oh, That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl...Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive       

So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Rising up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tigerDon't think sorry is easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me, that's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'

Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me, the sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore
To know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind 

Don't leave false illusion behind
Don't cry I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
'Cause I ain't gonna live anymore
Believing some of the lies 
While all of the signs are deceiving

I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore
To know that

When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new

Now, five years later on, you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
When you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? Oh!
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? Oh!

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you

The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
When you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom Angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my Angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by, I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom Angel on the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My Angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
(Angel is the centerfold)

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
When Angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold
Yeah, my memory has just been sold
My Angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (Oh, yeah!)

Yeah, now listen
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no Never-Never Land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My Angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold

I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

Thursday morning was a hot-flash factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Doo-dloo-dloo
Test-strip proofsheet love is hard to find

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

Little things I should have
Said and done

You were always on my mind

It's easy to see
But it's not that I don't care, so
'Cause I hear it all the time
But they never let you know
On the TV and the radio (Cha!)
She was young, her heart was pure
But every night is bright she got
She said sugar is sweet
She come a-rappin' to the beat
Then I knew that she was hot

She was singin'
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
You're in his eye and you'll know why
The more you live, the faster you will die

Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?

She said, "Babe, you know
I miss Jill and Joe
And all my funky friends"
But my street understanding
Was just enough to know what she really meant
And I got to thinking while she was talking
That I know she told the story
Of those special places that she goes
A-when she rides with the others in the subway singin'

Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
And if he talks to you and you don't know why
You say your life is gonna make you die

Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?

(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
(Cha, cha)
(Cha, cha, cha, cha)
(Cha, cha)

Well, we meet Jill and Joe
And brother Herr
With the whole cool gang and oh
They're rappin' here, they're rappin' there
But she's climbin' on the wall
It's a clear case, Herr Kommissar
'Cause all the children know
They're all slidin' down into the valley
They're all slipping on the same snow

Hear the children
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
He's got the power and you're so weak
And your frustration will not let you speak
La la la la la la

Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
And if he talks to you, then you'll know why
The more you live, the faster you will die

Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
(Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?)
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Der Kommissar's in town, wa-uh-oh
Don't turn around, wa-uh-ohI know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

(Note: These italicized lyrics only appear on the demo recording sung by Rory Dodd)
I can make your money double
Or I can make you lose your shirt
I can make your old wounds start to heal
Or I can make the new ones hurt

I can make the music louder
Or I can make the songs all fade
I can make every girl just wanna get up and dance
And make the boys in the band start to play

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love) out of nothing at all
(Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love)

Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love)
Out of nothing at all (Making love, love, love)Ooh, ooh

Listen boy
Don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make
The same mistakes I made

She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Oh, listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul

You're a big boy now
And you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Wooh, wooh

Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly

When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there

Tell her about it
Everyday before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

'Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy
It's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that
Won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real

Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long

You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late

You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tellOh, oh

Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She's been living in her white bread world (white bread world)
As long as anyone with hot blood can (hot blood can)
And now she's looking for a downtown man (downtown man)
That's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love

With an uptown girl (uptown girl)
You know I've seen her in her uptown world (uptown world)
She's getting tired of her high class toys (high class toys)
And all the presents from her uptown boys (uptown boys)
She's got a choice

Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been (I've been)
And then I'll win

And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love

With an uptown girl (oh)
She's been living in her white bread world (oh)
As long as anyone with hot blood can (oh)
And now she's looking for a downtown man (oh)
That's what I am

Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girlUntil you've been beside a man
You don't know what he wants
You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't

When nothin' comes easy
Old nightmares are real
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

Once inside a woman's heart
A man must keep his head
Heaven opens up the door
Where angels fear to tread

Some men go crazy
Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon

Everywhere it's all around
Comfort in a crowd
Strangers faces all around
Laughin' right out loud

Hey watch where you're goin'
Step light on old toes
'Cause until you've been beside a man
You don't know who he knows

Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon
Oh, blame it on midnight
Ooh, shame on the moon

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Blame it on midnight
You can blame it on midnight
Shame, shame, shame, shame on the moon
You can blame it on midnight
Shame on the moon

Blame it on the moon(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms

Every now and then I get a little bit angry
And I know I have to get out and cry

Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
But then I see the look in your eyes

Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
(All of the time)

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
(Forever's gonna start tonight)

Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

(Turn around bright eyes)
(Turn around bright eyes)

(Turn around)
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy
You always wanted to be
(Turn around)
But every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy
Who wanted me the way that I am

(Turn around)
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you

Every now and then I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around bright eyes)
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight (and I need you)
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight (if you'll only)
Well be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right (and we'll never)
'Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Love is like a shadow on me all of the time

A total eclipse of the heart

(Turn around bright eyes)
(Turn around bright eyes)
(Turn around)Give me time to realize my crime
Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real?

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Precious kisses, words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why

In my heart the fire's burning
Choose my color, find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

Words are few I have spoken
I could waste a thousand years
Wrapped in sorrow, words are token
Come inside and catch my tears

You've been talking but believe me
If it's true you do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything's not what you see
It's over again

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears

Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
(Time, time, time...)

Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch we touch was the heat too much
I felt I lost you from the start

Ooh, in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
(Time, time, time...)

Ooh, in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time

And you know time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time

And you know time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something realLet's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
Tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all

Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance

Just give me something, something I can use
People love it when you lose
They love dirty laundry

Well, I could've been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear
Give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleach-blonde, comes on at five
She can tell you 'bout the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die
Give us dirty laundry

Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set
We need dirty laundry

You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone
Keep your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around)

Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
Love to cut you down to size
We love dirty laundry

We can do the innuendo, we can dance and sing
When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king
Give us dirty laundry

So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

I met her there in the corner stands
And wonders where she is
And it's strange to her
Some people seem to have everything

9 a.m. on the hour hand and
She's waiting for the bell
And she's looking real pretty
She's waiting for her clientèle

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there

It's a sacrifice working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
Just to hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She already knows she's seen her bad times
She already knows these are the good times
She'll never sell out
She never will
Not for a dollar bill
She works hard...

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year maybe no go
I know you're watching me every minute of the day yeah
I've seen the signs and the looks and the pictures
They give your game away yeah
There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please please tell me now
Is there something I should know
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way
Do you feel the same 'cause you don't let it show

People stare and cross the road from me
And jungle drums they all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind can you see in the snow
And fiery demons all dance
When you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me
You're about as easy as a nuclear war
'Cause the dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I got so far before I had to say

Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

You're always on the run now
Running after somebody
You gotta get him somehow

I think you've got to slow down
Before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown
So be careful not to show it

You really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria?

Gloria
Don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh
Calling Gloria

Gloria (Gloria)
I think they got your number (Gloria)
I think they got the alias (Gloria)

But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said?
All the voices in your head
Calling, Gloria?

A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, Gloria
How's it gonna go down?
Will you meet him on the main line
Or will you catch him on the rebound?

Will you marry for the money
Take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away
Don't believe it's comin' back soon

And you really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
All the voices in your head
Calling, Gloria?

Gloria
Don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer

Ooh, baby let's get down tonight, whoo

Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby

And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby, ohhh
Come take control, just grab ahold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate

(Heal me, my darling)

I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
Oh when I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
I got to have sexual healing, darling, 'cause I'm all alone
Sexual healing, darling, till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbateTravelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

"Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty"
And he said:

"Oh! Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"

"Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"

"Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"

"Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover"I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations that
I know will be all right
It's just overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade away
Ghosts appear and fade awayS-A-F-E-T-Y

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
(You know what you did
(She says he is my son
Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover

Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it

You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her hair against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Ooh, oh
Oh

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac, at your door (at your door)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac, at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before(We are young, we are young)
We are young
(Heartache to heartache, we stand)
Heartache to heartache, we stand
(No promises, no promises, no demands)
No promises, no demands
(Love is a battlefield, love is a battlefield)
Love is a battlefield
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're begging me go then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know, do I stand in your way?
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand (Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
(Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
(Ahh)

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We're losing control, will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand (Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
(Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
(Ahh)

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefieldI found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Well it hijacked my world at night
To a place in the past we've been cast out of, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Now we're back in the fight

We're back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)

Circumstance beyond our control, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
The phone, the TV and the news of the world
Got in the house like a pigeon from Hell, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies

And put us back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, (ho-ah) back on the chain gang

The powers that be
That force us to live like we do
Bring me to my knees
When I see what they've done to you

Well, I'll die as I stand here today
Knowing that deep in my heart
They'll fall to ruin one day
For making us part...

I found a picture of you, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
Those were the happiest days of my life
Like a break in the battle was your part, o-o-oh, o-o-oh
In the wretched life of a lonely heart

Now I'm back on the train, yeah (ho-ah)
O-oh, back on the chain gang (ho-ah)Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

So you think I got an evil mind
I'll tell you honey
I don't know why

Lord, I gotta sing, it's some disgrace
I'm in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
No, no, no

Come on, feel the noise
Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild

Girls, rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah
Ah, ah, ahI was as wrong as I could be
To let you get away from me
I'll regret that move
For as long as I'm livin'

But now that I've come to see the light
All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word
And tell me that I'm forgiven

You and me
We're gonna be
Better than we were before
I loved you then but now I intend
To open up and love you even more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

Looking back now
It seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted

But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love
That still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see
It's gonna be
Sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to given more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

Oh
So if you'll just say
You want me too

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you goSo true
Funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound

I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

I know this much is true
I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin (All night long)
This is the sound of my soul
This is the sound

Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be known

I know this much is true
I know this much is true

I bought a ticket to the world
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

I know this much is true
I know this much is true
This much is true

This much is a-true
This much is a-true
I know, I know, I know this much is true
This much is a-true
This much is a-true

This much is a-true
This much is a-true
I know this much is true

This much is a-true
This much is a-true
Know this much is true

This much is a-true
This much is a-true
I know, I know, I know this much is trueNo one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First he took my heart then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I say unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line (standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

Do not turn away, my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more than you could do
But one man did not call
He asked me for my love and that was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line (standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

So I walked on far down the line away from you
Maybe your attention was more than I could do
One man did not fall
Well, he asked me for my love
That was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line (standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I could cry

I need, I need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy

Well, you could be standing in (stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (stand back)
Take me home
Take me home (stand back)
Won't you take me home

Well, I need a little sympathy (stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (stand back)
Why don't you take me home
Why don't you take me home (stand back)
Take me home
Why don't you take me homeHey, man, I don't feel like goin' to school no more
Me neither, they can't make you go, no you daddy, oh yeah

I ain't goin' to school, it starts too early for me
Well, listen man, I ain't goin' to school no more
It starts much, much too early for me
I don't care about readin', writin', 'rithmetic or history

I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
Well, she's the only girl in this whole world who understands me

Well, she's sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound, shake it around, you're mine, mine, mine

Johnny and Eddie and me and Jimmy and Jack
Are gonna do a little number on the teacher when she turns her back
We're gonna cut out of class, meet the girls by the railroad track

Well ev'ry Friday night, there's a band that you gotta hear
Just a dollar ticket in and twenty-five cents a beer
They play rock n' roll music like it hasn't been rocked for years

Well, she's sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound and shake it around, you're mine, mine, mine, all mine

Oh c'mon, baby, yeah

Well, when I hear that rockin' beat, I can't sit still up out of my seat
Come on babe, let's jump around your feet
Can't learn nothin' in school, they don't teach you on the street

Wo-oh, wo-oh, baby, I like your style
Wo-oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, I like your style
You don't care what the other kids say, you go real wild

Well, you're sexy and 17, my little rock n' roll queen
Acts a little bit obscene, gotta let off a little steam
Dig that sound and shake it around, you're mine, mine, mine, mine
Dig that sound and shake it around you're mine, mine, mine, mine
Dig that sound and shake it around you're mine, mine, mineBlack and orange stray cat sittin' on a fence 
Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent 
I'm flat broke, but I don't care 
I strut right by with my tail in the air 

Stray cat strut, I'm a (Ladies' cat)
I'm a feline Casanova (Hey, man, that's where it's at) 
Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man 
Get my dinner from a garbage can 

Meow
Yeah, don't cross my path 

I don't bother chasing mice around, oh, no
I slink down the alley looking for a fight 
Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night 
Singin' the blues while the lady cats cry
"Wild stray cat, you're a real gone guy
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class, and I got cat style"

You're wondering who I am
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Machine or mannequin
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
With parts made in Japan
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the modren man

I've got a secret I've been hiding
Under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling
My brain IBM

So if you see me acting strangely
Don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone
And somewhere to hide

To keep me alive
Just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide
To keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions
I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems
So we can be free

I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior
Forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances
Went beyond his control

Beyond my control
We all need control
I need control
We all need control

Too much technology
Machines to save our lives
Machines dehumanize

The time has come at last

Now everyone can see

Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz

Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Tryin' hard to look like Gary Cooper
(Super duper)

Come, let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts
Puttin' on the Ritz

Have you seen the well-to-do?
Up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air
High hats and arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?

Puttin' on the RitzThe deception with tact
Just what are you trying to say?
You got a blank face, which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece
You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross
Leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover so discreet
Why don't they

Do what they say
Say what you mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another

The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see
Comes from living close to your fears
If this is up, then I'm up
But you're running out of sight
You've seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump
Leads to shock miss a beat
You run for cover and there's heat
Why don't they

Do what they say
Say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another

Then it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me
But when the wrong word
Goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me
It's getting rough, off the cuff
I've got to say enough's enough
Bigger the harder, he falls
But when the wrong antidote
Is like a bulge on the throat
You run for cover in the heat
Why don't they

Do what they say
Say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong
I know I listen too long
But then one thing leads to another
Yeah, yeah

One thing (one, one thing) leads to another (one, another, thing, one thing)
One thing (one, one thing) leads to another (one, another, thing, one thing)

It's the same old thing as yesterday
There's a black hat caught in a high tree top
There's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop

I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny to be the king of pain

There's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread

King of pain

There's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack (that's my soul up there)
There's a black winged gull with a broken back (that's my soul up there)

It's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
But she blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!) 
Failed me in geometry, hey-ey, huh, huh

Now
Huh, huh

When I'm dancing close to her
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
I can smell the chemicals
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
(Science!)

Now, but, it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
Sweet as any harmony
She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!) 
Failed me in geometry
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)

When she's dancing next to me
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)
(Hmm hmm, hmm hmm, hmm)
I can hear machinery
(Blinding me with science, science)
(Science!)

Ha! It's poetry in motion
Now she's making love to me
The spheres are in commotion
The elements in harmony
She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And hit me with technology

(Good heavens, Miss Sakamoto - you're beautiful!)

I -
I don't believe it!
There she goes again!
She's tidied up, and I can't find anything!
All my tubes and wires
And careful notes
And antiquated notions 
But it's poetry in motion
When she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
Huh, she blinded me with science
(She blinded me with - with science!)
She blinded me with 
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh)Oh Mickey, you're so fine

Hey Mickey
You've been around all night and that's a little long
You think you've got the right, but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight? So you can take me home Mickey?

'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please, baby don't
Every night you still leave me alone Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Hey Mickey
Now when you take me by the hooves, who's ever gonna know
And every time you move I let a little more show
There's something you can use, so don't say no Mickey

So come on and give it to me anyway you can
Anyway you want to do it, I'll take it like a man
But please baby, please don't leave me in the damp Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand?
It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, you're so fine

It's guys like you, Mickey
Oh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the handI hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)

I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take some time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh oohI'm all out of hope
One more bad break
Could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release

(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face

I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face

When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket, then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas, oh, the gigolo cool
Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinking it down, oh

I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise
Now all I can do
Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realize

(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
Your eyes without a face
Such a human waste
Your eyes without a face

And now it's getting worseShe's simply awesome

She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the cream 
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah 
Ah she said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

I was in search of a good time 
Just running my game 
Love was the furthest 
From my mind 

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream 
And our hearts, they beat as one 
No more love on the run 

I lose my cool when she steps in the room 
And I get so excited just from her perfume 
Electric eyes that you can't ignore 
And passion burns you like never before 

I was in search of a good time 
Just running my game, yeah
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind, yeah

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream (don't wanna stop)
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run (I love ya, I need ya)

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream 
And our hearts they beat as one (ooh yeah)
No more love on the run

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream 
And our hearts they beat as one 
No more love on the run

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the cream, my Carribean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans
Now that I found love, I won't let her go
She's the cream
Oh love, you, love you, love, you, love you
Oh, she dashed by me in painted jeans
She's the cream, Carribean Queen

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the cream, my Carribean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
She's the cream, my Carribean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeahI get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way

I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just livin' in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sittin' 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, gimme just one look

You can't start a fire
Sittin' 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Hey, baby!(Chak-chak-chak-chaka Khan, Chaka Khan
Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan)

(Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, baby, feel for you)

(Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you wanna do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you?
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too)

(Let me take you in my arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make it more than just a physical dream
I wanna rock you, Chaka, baby, 'cause you make me wanna scream)

(Let me rock you, rock you)

Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

(Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, let me feel for you, feel for you)

Baby, baby, when I lay with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

Ohohohoho...

Just one more time
Say, yeah!

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I, I think I love you

(Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
Let me rock you, let me feel for you)

(Feel for you)

Oh, I feel for you (Feel for you)
Ohohoho, I feel for you (Feel for you)

I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you

I feel for you
I think I love youI guess I thought
You'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what
You got until it's gone
And I found out too little too late

I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there

But then you were gone
And it all was wrong
Had no idea
How much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you, baby
You're a hard habit to break

You found someone else
You had every reason
You know I can't blame you
For running to him

Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading
My love too thin

After all of these years
I'm still trying to be shaken
Doing much better
They say that it just takes time

But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you, baby
You're a hard habit to break

I can't go on, just can't go on
I can't go on, just can't go on

Being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you
You're a hard habit to break

Just can't go on
(Such a hard habit to break)
Just can't go on
I'm addicted to you

You're a hard habit to break
Just can't go on
(Such a hard habit to break)
I'm addicted to you, babyDesert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies, would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along, you string along

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival

I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and green, red, gold and green

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold and greenMiss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

Bet you got a good gun
Bet you know how
To have some fun and then
You turn it around on me because
I'm better than the rest of the men

I say you'll miss me
And you always do
I say you'll miss me
Now would I lie to you

Now there's no need to demand
Grab my golden hand
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure
If the way that you need
Is too much like greed
Decide if you are rich or you're poor

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

Bet you make the fool run
Bet you know how
To make it last forever
But you know I'm never really sure
If you're just kissing to be clever

I say you'll miss me
And you always do
I say you'll miss me
Now would I lie to you

Now there's no need to demand
Grab my golden hand
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure
If the way that you need
Is too much like greed
Decide if you are rich or you're poor

Because this love
That I have to give
Must be better than that kind
It can make you rich
It can make you poor
But I know that you'll miss me blind

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blind

Now there's no need to demand
Grab my golden hand
I'll teach you and you'll never be sure
If the way that you need
Is too much like greed
Decide if you are rich or you're poor

I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me
I know you'll miss me blindAll through the night
I'll be awake
And I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time
When time is new
Oh
All through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying

We have no past
We won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten
What binding they lack
Oh
Under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

We have no past
We won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end

Oh
The sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there, let me stay there a while

We have no past
We won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no endI come home, in the mornin' light

Oh mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones

Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
(I will be waiting) Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

He ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway

And maybe he don't dress fine
But I don't really mind
'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer

Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand

Oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my lovin' one-man show
Oh, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy

My baby may not be rich
He's watchin' every dime
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
We always have a real good time

And maybe he sings off-key
But that's alright by me, yeah
'Cause what he does, he does so well
Makes me wanna yell

Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand

But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line

I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh whoa
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh whoa

Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

Oh, why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is an only child
He's waiting by the park
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride and I wanna get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and the TV set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

Why-y-y-y-y why why why-y-y (yeah)
Why-y-y-y-y why why why-y-y (yeah)

Ah, the reflex, what a game
He's hiding all the cards
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question markTelegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing my senses together
And I think it's about to break

If I listen close, I can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength at least give me a light
Give me anything even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right

If I listen close, I can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb

Through the borderline

If I listen close, I can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh
Voices in your body coming through on the radio

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
It's gonna race, it's gonna break
Gonna move up to the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
Moving up, it's gonna race, it's gonna break
Through the borderline

The union of the snake is on the climb
It's gonna race, it's gonna break
Gonna move up to the borderlineDon't wish it away 
Don't look at it like it's forever 
Between you and me 
I could honestly say 
That things can only get better 

And while I'm away 
Dust out the demons inside 
And it won't be long 
Before you and me run 
To the place in our hearts 
Where we hide 

And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
Laughing like children, living like lovers 
Rolling like thunder under the covers 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 

Just stare into space 
Picture my face in your hands 
Live for each second 
Without hesitation 
And never forget I'm your man 

Wait on me girl 
Cry in the night if it helps 
But more than ever
I simply love you 
More than I love life itself 

And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
Laughing like children, living like lovers 
Rolling like thunder under the covers 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 

Wait on me girl 
Cry in the night if it helps 
But more than ever
I simply love you 
More than I love life itself 

And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Time on my hands could be time spent with you 
Laughing like children, living like lovers 
Rolling like thunder under the covers 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 

(Laughing like children, living like lovers) 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
(Laughing like children, living like lovers) 
And I guess that's why they call it the blues 
And I guess that's why they call it the bluesGuess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
You know, sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
You know, sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When everything you do is going wrong
Sad songs say so muchHere comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

Here comes the rain again
Raining in my hand like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do

So baby, talk to me
Like lovers do

I want to walk in the open wind

Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like at new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

Here comes the rain again
Falling on my hand like a memory
Falling on my hand like a new emotionThree, four!

Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs

Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you got

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- strange days indeed

Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move
Everyone's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Katmandu

Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in the movies you just gotta lay around

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama

Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's a UFO over New York and I ain't too surprised

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama, roll!(Missing you)

Every time I think of you 
I always catch my breath 
And I'm still standing here 
And you're miles away 
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

Ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself
Ain't missing you

I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you
Ain't missing you
Oh no

No matter what my friends might say
I ain't missing youBeen workin' so hard
I'm punchin' my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I've got

I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playin' so cool
Obeyin' every rule
But dig way down in your heart
You're burnin', yearnin' for some

Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-ee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah
(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah
(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah

First, we've got to turn you around
Second, and put your feet on the ground
Third, now take a hold of your soul
Ba, ba, ba
Ba!

I'm turnin' it loose!
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Footloose) Footloose (footloose), kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody, everybody cut footloose!Joanna, I love you

Believe me, baby
Believe what I sayOh, the night is my world
City light, painted pearls
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walking
Down the street of my soul

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me living only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control

Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

I
I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes

A safe night
I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go

Oh, the night is my world
City light, painted pearls
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me living only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control

I
I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never knows

A safe night
I'm living in the forest of a dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go

You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control

I
I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
I'm living in the forest of a dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
Is my world
City light, painted pearls

You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control... (Fade out)I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

But I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love youI'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose

Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

I'm stuck on you
Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way

So hard to see
That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time, little darling, I'm coming home to stay

I'm stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way

Guess I'm on my way
I'm mighty glad you stayedYou must be my lucky star

Starlight, star bright yeahLast night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China 
In a little row boat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no-one to hold you 
What does that mean
And you said 

Ain't nothin' gonna to break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh-no
I got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

You're on the road and now you pray it lasts 
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast
And she said 

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh-no 
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground 
Oh-no, I got to keep on moving

Never let another girl like you, work me over
Never let another girl like you, drag me under
If I meet another girl like you, I will tell her
Never want another girl like you, have to say
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch the ground
Oh-no, I got to keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down 
Oh-no, oh-no, I got to keep on movingIt's close to midnight, and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night 
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a, killer, thriller tonight, yeah

You hear the door slam, and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while, you hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
(Thriller, thriller night)
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life 

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you, unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close together (Yeah)
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Thriller, thriller night)
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller, thriller here tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Thriller, thriller night)
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, baby 
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Oh, darling 
I'm gonna thrill you tonight 
Ooh, baby 
I'm gonna thrill you tonight 
Oh, darling 
Thriller night, baby 

The foulest stench is in the air 
The funk of forty-thousand years 
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb 
Are closing in to seal your doom 
And though you fight to stay alive 
Your body starts to shiver 
For no mere mortal can resist 
The evil of the thrillerHast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt

Neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für UFOs aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'Ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Es gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: "Krieg!" und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig jahre Krieg
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Düsenflieger
Heute zieh ich meine Runden
Seh die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk an dich und lass ihn fliegenSister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one to say okay
Where you going, what you looking for?
You know those boys don't wanna play no more with you
It's true

You're motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding Mister Right?
You'll be all right tonight

Babe, you know you're growing up so fast
And Mama's worrying that you won't last to say, let's play
Sister Christian, there's so much in life
Don't you give it up before your time is due
It's true

Sister Christian, oh, the time has come
And you know that you're the only one to say okay
But you're motoring
You're motoringDo we deserve a second chance? 
How did we fall into this circumstance? 
We weren't so straight and narrow 
This is much more than we deserve 

A higher voice has called the tune 
Two hearts that lost the beat will now resume 
The gift of life extension 
By divine intervention 

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
Telling me to get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around 

Don't understand what's going on 
Woke up this morning, all the hurt was gone 
This is a new beginning 
I'm back in the land of the living 

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
And I gotta get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
Oh, I'm gonna get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait 
You know I gotta get it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing 
Without the love you bring 
Love is what we've found 
The second time around

It's gotta be a strange twist of fate 
Telling me that Heaven can wait
You know I gotta get it right
I'm gonna make it right this time
Life doesn't mean a thing
Without the love you bring
Love is what we've found
The second time around
It's gotta be a strange twist of fate
Telling me that Heaven can wait(Paul)

Just the memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now 
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me nowDearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life
Electric word "life"
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, there's something else
The afterworld

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun
Day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

Woo!

If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She just picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Aah, aah!" is all I heard

I'm not gonna let de-elevator bring us down
Oh no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go!

Uh-huh!

All excited, but don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for)
Better live now
Before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
Tell me baby

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go!

Come on, baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah, crazy

Let's go crazy

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go

Go crazy
Woo! Huh!
I said, let's go (go) crazy (crazy)
Let's go (let's go)
Let's go (let's go)

Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling, can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride

How could you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold

Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World is so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
(I'm like my father, you know, you know he's too bold)

Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream, why?)
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry

When doves cry
Don't cry
Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't don't cryGhostbusters

GhostbustersI can see the path you're cutting
It cost me a little piece of my heart 
I can see the doors you're shutting
'Cause they were open at the start

Baby, loving you has been hard on me 
You're such a tough little sister
Just looking for Mr. Right 
On the wrong side of town 

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait 
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate 
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night 

Your eyes are wild, your skin's so white
You're undernourished and overfed 
She's got the teeth, she knows how to bite
'Cause when you bit I bled 

You got the perfect image
Of the perfect man 
You're a tough little sister
But you'll settle for a mister tonight 
But you're running out of time 

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait 
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate 
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night

I'm only saying what I feel
You think I'm wrong I know 
You thought I was sleeping at the wheel
I thought that you were driving 

You better love somebody
You better love somebody

You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait 
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate 
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night 

One night - oh oh oh oh
One night - oh oh oh oh
One night - oh oh oh oh
One night - oh oh oh ohWho's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from 9 to 5, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone, in my average home
But why do I always feel
Like I'm in the Twilight Zone? And

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bang the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Or can the people on TV see me, or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

Who's watching me?
I don't know anymore!
Are the neighbors watching me?
Who's watching?
Well, is the mailman watching me?
Tell me, who's watching?
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
Who?
The IRS?!

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa (hee hee hee)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
Who's watching me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Ooh, whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, can it be? (hee hee hee)
Who's watching me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
Who's watching me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Can I have my privacy?
Whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, it's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though oh, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, of my heart

No New Year's day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
I just called (just called) to say (to say) how much I care, I do
I just called (just called) to say (to say) I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart, baby of my heartWho's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong 
But now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up 
When you fall? 
Who's gonna hang it up 
When you call? 

Who's gonna pay attention 
To your dreams? 
Yeah, who's gonna plug their ears 
When you scream? 

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
But now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down 
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around 
When you break? 

You can't go on 
Thinking nothing's wrong
But now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Oh, you know you can't go on 
Thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?Yeah, come on baby

It makes me wild

You take it to me good

Look at me, Look at me
Look at me, look at me (look at me)
(Oh look at me ee)Look what you're doing to me
I'm utterly at your whim
All of my defenses down

Your camera looks through me
With its X-ray vision
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in a circuitry

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down
Automatic (automatic)
Automatic (automatic)

What is this madness
That makes my motor run
And my legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

My hands perspire 
And shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure
They tell me

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down
Automatic (automatic)
Automatic (automatic)

Automatic, automatic
Automatic, automatic

Look what you're doing to me
I'm utterly at your whim
All of my defenses down

Your camera looks through me
With its X-ray vision
And all systems run aground

All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intended to speak
Wind up locked in the circuitry

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down

No way to control it
It's totally automatic
Whenever you're around

I'm walking blindfolded
Completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down, down, down
Automatic (automatic)
Automatic (automatic)Your eyes tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited, I can feel you
Getting hotter, oh baby
I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more, more

Jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then

Jump, jump for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms
Can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my love

You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try and
Go much farther, oh baby
You are the one, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more,
If you want more, more, more then

Jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then

Jump, jump for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms

Jump if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump, jump
Jump, you know my heart can
Make you happy
Jump, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump in, you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my loveWhen you close your eyes and you go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreaming about
When you open up your heart, and the truth comes out

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know you're sleeping in the spotlight?
And all your dreams that you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When you close your eyes and you fall asleep
Everything about you is a mystery

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleepI have a picture
Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and
We're laughing and loving it all

But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and
Delighting with tears
As we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start)

You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching
For some perfect world
We know we'll never find

So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be 
Than with you here today
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start)

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let loving start
(Let loving start) whoa

You ask if I love you
Well, what can I say?
You know that I do
And that this is just one 
Of those games that we play

So I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry any more
I'll even ask your forgiveness
Though I don't know 
Just what I'm asking it for
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
(Hold me in your loving arms)
Warm my heart
(Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me
(Ooohooohooo stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start

Hold me now, whoa
(Hold me in your loving arms)
Warm my heart
(Warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me
(Ooohooohooo stay with me)
Let loving start
Let loving start

(Repeat chorus 4 times till fade out)Prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell
(Captured)

Oh, yes, I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion?
Should I?
Should I?

Oh, you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Yeah, better be good

C'mon, c'mon
Be good to me

I think it's also right 
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case

Yes, I know
You keep telling me that you love me
And I really do wanna believe
But did you think I'd just accept you 
In blind faith?
Oh, sure, babe
Anything to please you

But you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have the time
For your over-loaded lines
But you better be good to me
Yeah, you better be good, good to me

Be good to me

And I really don't see 
Why it's so hard to be 
Good to me

And you know, I don't understand
What's your plan 
That you can't be good to me?

What I can't feel
I surely cannot see
Why can't you be good to me?

If it's not real
I do not wish to see
Why don't you be good to me?

Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Why can't you be good to me?
Be good
(Good to me)
Be good to me

'Cause I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time 
For your over-loaded lines

So you better be good to me!
Yeah, you better be good
Better be good to me
Better be good
(Why can't you be good to me?) 

'Cause I don't have the time 
For your over-loaded lines
And I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth

And you better be good to me
(Why can't you be good to me?) 
Be good to me
(Why can't you be good to me?) 
Be good
(Why can't you be good to me?) 
Be good to me
(Why can't you be good to me?) 

'Cause I don't have no use 
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time 
For your over-loaded lines

You better be good to me
(Why can't you be) 
Good to me
(Good to me?)
Better be 
(Why can't you be) 
Good to me
(Good to me?)
Be good
(Why can't you be good to me?) 
Be good to me
(Why can't you be) 
Good to me
(Good to me?)
Why can't you be 
(Why can't you be) 
Good to me? 
(Good to me?)
Why can't you be 
(Why can't you be) 
Good to me? 
(Good to me?) 
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Be good to meYou must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That is only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Ooh

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

(What's love) got to do
Got to do do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

(What's love got to do)
Ooh, got to do do with it?
(What's love but a sweet second-hand emotion?)
What's love got to do got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?I get up and nothing gets me down
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around
And I know, baby just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real

Ah, can't you see me standin' here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (jump)
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump

Oh! Hey you! Who said that?
Baby, how you been?
You say you don't know
You won't know until you begin

So can't you see me standing here?
I got my back against the record machine
I ain't the worst that you've seen
Ah, can't you see what I mean?

Ah, might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Jump

Might as well jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump
Get in and jump (jump)
Go ahead and jump

You put the boom-boom into my heart
You send my soul sky-high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain (yeah, yeah)
Goes bang-bang-bang till my feet do the same

But something's bugging me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me
What you did last night

You left me sleeping
In my bed
I was dreaming
But I should've been with you instead

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah yeah

You get the gray skies outta my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same

'Cause you're my lady
I'm your fool
It makes me crazy
When you act so cruel

Come on, baby
Let's not fight
We'll go dancing
Everything will be alright

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

(Jitterbug)
(Jitterbug)

Cuddle up, baby
Move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night

It's cold out there
But it's warmer in bed
They can dance
We'll stay home instead

(Jitterbug)

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
(Don't you dare to leave me hanging on like a yo-yo-yo-yo)
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high (Take me dancing)

Wake me up before you go-go (A boom-boom-boom-boom, oh)
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo (A boom-boom-boom-boom)
Wake me up before you go-go (Yeah yeah yeah)
Take me dancing tonight (Ooh ah, yeah hah)Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or loser

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you - and that's the only way
Shake - shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only

You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision
They confused me so (Owner of a lonely heart)
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap (Owner of a lonely heart)
And don't you hesitate at all, no no
Yow!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than an
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart (Owner of a lonely heart)
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start (Owner of a lonely heart)

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all (Owner of a lonely heart)
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Just receive it
