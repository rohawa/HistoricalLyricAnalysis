There's beauty up above,
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by ya
Make you look like a fool, boy

Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in; he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Alright!

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back at school she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed

Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Oooh!

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink 'til I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

Yeah, just sittin' back trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
But boring stories of

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms

We're in Heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in Heaven

Oh, once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Bought it at the Five and Dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Hey!

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69

Oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

Yay!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69 - Uh hu-huh
It was the summer of '69 - Oh yeah
Me and my baby in a 69 - Oh

Is all we're asking for
'Cause just a little more time
Could open closing doors
Just a little uncertainty
Can bring you down

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence
That has conquered some

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
No one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender
To never surrender

Oh, time is all we're asking for
To never surrender
Oh, oh, you can never surrender

Time is all you're asking for
Stand your ground, never surrender
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I said
You never surrender, ohWell, east coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear

They knock me out when I'm down there

They keep their boyfriends warm at night

And all of the madness has got you going crazy.

Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators

That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Money for nothin' and chicks for freeNobody on the road, nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home

But I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow, and smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, "don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby 
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have goneMeeting you
With a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places
Feel the chill

Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea
Could it be the whole Earth opening wide?

A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you
Is a view to a kill
Between the shades
Assassination standing still

First crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

Again we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see is the view to a killThe wild boys are calling 
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to 
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered 
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside 
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us, 
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome 
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while 
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels 
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over 
Secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you 
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shineWould I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

My friends - know what's in store.
I won't be here anymore.
I've packed my bags
I've cleaned the floor.
Watch me walkin'.
Walkin' out the door.

Believe me - I'll make it make it
Believe me - I'll make it make it

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

Tell you straight - no intervention.
To your face - no deception.
You're the biggest fake.
That much is true.
Had all I can take.
Now I'm leaving you

Believe me - I'll make it make it
Believe me - I'll make it make it

Would I lie to you?
Would I lie to you honey?
Now would I say something that wasn't true?
I'm asking you sugar
Would I lie to you?

Believe me - I'll make it make it
Believe me - I'll make it make it

Would I lie to you?I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I'd better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ohhh

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Up through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh, oh, ooh

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

Inside your head, on every beat
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Tell me can you feel it

The heat is on, the heat is on (oh yeah)
The heat is on (burnin' burnin' burnin')
Oh it's on the street
The heat is... on

The shadows are on the darker side
Behind those doors, it's a wilder ride
You can make a break, you can win or lose
That's a chance you take, when the heat's on you
When the heat is on

Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho
Caught up in the action
I've been looking out for you
Oh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho

The heat is on (Flames are burnin' higher)
(Fade Out)The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it starting
All over again

The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls

You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat

The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done

Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your blood
It's in your moves
You're a man of the street

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it

You can hear it hey
You're getting near it hey
You wanna make it whoa
'Cause you can take it whoa

You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night

You belong
You belong
OhInstrumentalOh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never, never choose
Even if you try, yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on 
Just running away
If we stay any longer 
We will surely never get away

Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around 
Never let them shoot us down
Never, never, never
Never run away

Hey baby you know it's true
Why you bother lying
When you know that you want it to
Don't you dare deny me

Walk those legs right over here
Give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love
Hold me down, let me go

We can't go on 
Just running away
If we wait any longer 
We will surely never get away

Whoa, oh, anything you want we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around 
Never let them shoot us down

Never, never (no), never
Never run away

Never, no never, never
Never run away

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah

You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love
Your chance to let me know

We can't go on just running away
If we stay any longer 
We will surely never get away

Whoa, never
Whoa, never

We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never

Whoa, never
Whoa, never

We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never

Whoa, never
Whoa, neverWe're not scared to lose it all
Security throw through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand skeptic hands
Won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)

Treating today as though it was
The last, the final show
Get to sixty and feel no regret
It may take a little time 
A lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Ah!

Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)

Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa oh-oh-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa whoa whoa-whoa oh-oh-oh
(Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-oh)
Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh whoa-whoa whoa-oh-ohThe power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love, that's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But do be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go 'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?

It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel

You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of loveKissing you was not what I had planned
And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me
You're the only one I can think of
You're the only one I see

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

Yes it's true we've all been hurt before
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're making
Then I don't know what it is

All I need
Is just a little more time
To be sure what I feel
Is it all in my mind
Cause it seems so hard to believe

No stars are out tonight
But we're shining our own light
And it's never felt so bright
Cause girl the way I'm feeling
It's easy to believe
That you're all I need

Ah
You're all I need
Ooh ahInstrumentalGrowin' up
You don't see the writing on the wall
Passin' by
Movin' straight ahead, you knew it all

But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone
Everything has changed

Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on
Only you can do what must be done

You know in some way
You're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner
And you're tryin' to break free

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire, ooh

Burnin' up
Don't know just how far that I can go (Just how far I go)
Soon be home
Only just a few miles down the road

I can make it
I know I can
You broke the boy in me
But you won't break the man

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire
Burnin' in me, burnin' in me

Just once in his life
A man has his time
And my time is now
I'm comin' alive

I can hear the music playin'
I can see the banners fly
Feel like your man again
And hope ridin' high

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazin' sky
I'll be where the eagle's flyin'
Higher and higher

Gonna be your man in motion
All I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where the future's lyin'
St. Elmo's Fire

I can climb the highest mountain
Cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire burnin' in me

Burnin'
Burnin' in me
I can feel it burnin'
Ooh, burnin' inside of meEver since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die
But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes, it's much too late for goodbyes

Time has gone since I've been with you
We've been starting to lie
Now it seems you don't care for me
And I don't understand why
But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes, it's much too late for goodbyes

Ever since you've been far away
I've been wanting to fly
Now I know what you meant to me
I'm the one who should cry
And it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes, it's much too late for goodbyes

Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die
But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes, it's much too late for goodbyes

Ooh... Ah...

Dit dit dit dit doo
Ba da ba da ba da ba... ba
Ba ba ba ba ba... ba ba ba ba ba... baLet's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by

I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (oh)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (Baby, yeah)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
(Let's cherish every moment we have together)
For as long as we both shall live
(Hand in hand, you and I)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

(Spoken:)
Cherish the love
Cherish the life

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
(Let's cherish every moment we have together)
We should cherish the life we live
(Hand in hand, you and I)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the loveWhy am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby

Clouds just disappearSwaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close, but still a world away 
What I'm dying to say is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye, we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath, I'm deeper into you
Soon we too are standing still in time
If you read my mind

You'll see I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss

Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy crazy for you

It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah, I'm crazy for you

Crazy for you baby
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you babyYou've got style, that's what all the girls say
Satin sheets and luxuries so fine
All your suits are custom made in London
But I've got something that you'll really like

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Feel the silky touch of my caresses
They will keep you looking so brand new
Let me cover you with velvet kisses
I'll create a look that's made for you

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love
All over your body

Gonna dress you up in my love, in my love
All over your body, all over your body
In my love
All over, all over
From your head down to your toesI made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey!
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Woah, woah
Ahh, woah

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel I've nothin' to hide

Like a virgin, hey!
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ooh baby, yeah

Can't you hear my heart beat?
For the very first timeSome boys kiss me, some boys hug me, I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead, but they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance, that's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie, but I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come and boys may go, and that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich and now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

A material, a material, a material, a material world

Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world...Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each others' hands
This time might be the last, I fear
Unless I make it all too clear
I need you so, ohh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right, mmm
Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
I need you so

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly
Learn to live and love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in, yeah, yeah

Let us in
Let us in

Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly
Learn to live and love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up for us and let us in, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
OohThe American
Bangkok, Oriental Setting
But the city don't know what the city is getting
The crème de la crème of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies - doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tyrolean spa had the chess boards in it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings
Or
Or this place!

Company
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

The American
One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother

Company
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city

The American
Whattaya mean?!
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town

Company
T-girls1, warm and sweet (sweet)
Some are set up
In the Somerset Maugham suite

The American
Get Thai'd, you're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest:
"I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine"

Company
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

The American
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddha

But thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So, you better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors

Company
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to meEverybody's saying silly things
Without knowing that life brings a change
And I've been checking all the signs
My friends say I'm love sick 'cause I

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is all about)
And I won't be the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

(Cool it now) You got to cool it now
(Ooh, watch out) You're gonna loose control
(Cool it now) You got to slow it down
(Slow it down) You're gonna fall in love

Every day I walk her home from school
And she tells me how she really feels
And there's no doubt in my mind
That this girl is one of a kind, oh

Cause all I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Understand you're one of a kind)
And I won't feel the same until she is mine
But my friends keep telling me to

(Cool it now) You got to cool it now
(Ooh, watch out) You're gonna loose control
(Cool it now) You better slow it down
(Slow it down) You're gonna fall in love

All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is all about)
And I won't feel the same until you are mine
But my friends keep telling me

When you got a girl who takes her time
You must slow the pace, you can't mess with her mind
If she feels the same, she'll letcha know
Just prepare yourself or be ready to go
And I hope this message stays in your mind
Cause you almost lost a girl who is right on time
There's one more thing that you got to know
Just cool it down and stay in control

(Cool it now) You got to cool it now
(Ooh, watch out) You're gonna loose control
(Cool it now) You better slow it down
(Slow it down) Cause you're gonna fall in love

It's all I keep thinking about, is her in my arms
(Understand you're one of a kind)
And I'll never be the same until you are mine, oh
Listen to me, let me tell you

Why you all coming down on me
Tryin' to tell me how my life is supposed to be
I know you're only trying to help me out
Tryin' to show me what life is really about
But this time I'm gonna make it on my own
So why don't you fellas just leave me alone
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
If I like the girl, who cares who you like

(Cool it now) You got to cool it now
(Ooh, watch out) You're gonna loose control
(Cool it now) You better slow it down
(Slow it down) Cause you're gonna fall in love

Cool it now
Ooh watch out
'Cause you're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down...
You're gonna fall in love

Cool it now
Slow it down
You're gonna lose control

Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down...
Cause you're gonna fall in love

Cool it now
Slow it down
Cause you're gonna lose control

Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down...

Cool it now
Ooh watch out
Cool it now
Slow it downWe belong
We belong to the light

Many times I've tried to tell you
Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well
You cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong togetherHey, if we can solve any problem
Then why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, and so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same thing
Can't you see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on?

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know?

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Oh

I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause baby, can't ya see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on?

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Picking up the pieces, ooh (Every time you go away)
(You take a piece of me with you) Be careful
(Every time you go away) Everytime you go
(You take a piece of me with you) You take a piece of me

(Every time you go away) Oh
(You take a piece of me with you) Everytime you goThey came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
And nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
"I'm never coming back", I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Searchin' through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop until they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand, they never asked him why
"Get out of my way", I heard a shout, then a blinding light
All I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Don't give up, keep running, keep hiding
Now don't give up, oh Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up, 'cause you know that I am on your side
Don't give up, oh Billy

'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
I'm never coming back, I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,

Just staring at the phone

Then I thought, but maybe you're not alone

Oh please give me one more night,

I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you

To give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
You know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Ah give me just one more night,
Give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,
Oh give me that one more night
Just one more night,

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

It seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again, oh
I wouldn't change a stroke
Cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then, oh

(Raspberry beret) Oh
(The kind you find) The kind you find
(In a second hand store) The kind you find, oh no no
(Raspberry beret) Ah, uh-huhn
(And if it was warm) Where have all the raspberry women gone
(She wouldn't wear much more)

(Raspberry beret) Yeah, oh
I think I luh, I think I luh, I think I love her

(Raspberry beret) No, no, no
(The kind you find) No, no, no
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret) Tell me where
(And if it was warm) Have all the raspberry women gone
(She wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I say there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore
Ooh, ooh, oohLike I always say:
What's good for the goose is always good for the gander
Sheila

Oh baby, love me right
Let me love you 'til you get aroused
Can't you let the others be?
'Cause with you is where I got to be, yeah

Oh sugar, where you been
Making out with your male friends?
Listen, somebody's gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me

And we sing
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you 'til the morning comes
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Oh baby, understand
That I want to be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own friend

Oh baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill your needs
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just wait and see

And we sing
Sheila
Let me love you 'til the morning comes
Just tryin' to say

Oh baby, it's one, two, three
I love you baby honestly
I want to...

You know I want to be the only one

Here we goHe's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jukebox life, diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
Heaven help him, when he falls

Diamond life, lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights, business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
No sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast to coast, LA to Chicago
Western male
Across the north and south to Key Largo

Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross, yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold

Ooh ooh, whoa

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and

Love's strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me?
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down

Will you recognize me?
Call my name or walk on by?
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh ooh, whoa

Don't you try and pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity and security, ah

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Goin' to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?

When you walk on by
And you call my nameWe built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
Too many runaways eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone's always playing corporation games
Who cares, they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh
Then we just lost the beat

Who counts the money underneath the bar?
Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars?
Don't tell us you need us 'cause we're the ship of fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools

(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge on another gorgeous sunny Saturday and I'm seein' that bumper to bumper traffic.)

Don't you remember? (remember)

(Here's your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city, the city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps.)

To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong
With part-time lover

If she isn't with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word "discreet"
With part-time lovers

But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek to you
My part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

Part-time lover 
Part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you
My part-time lover

And then a man caught our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers

You and me
Part-time lovers
But she and he
Part-time lovers

Part-time loverFree, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free

If you need somebody
Call my name
If you want someone
You can do the same

If you want to keep something precious
Gotta lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold onto your possession

If it's a mirror you want
Just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy
Someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark
Tied up in chains you just can't see
Or a beast in a gilded cage
That's all some people ever want to be

If you love somebody

You can't control an independent heart (Can't love what you can't keep)
Can't tear the one you love apart (Can't love what you can't keep)
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
We can't live here and be happy with less
So many riches, so many souls
With everything we see that we want to possess

If you need somebody

(repeat until fade)How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyesWelcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the worldI wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against
The child in your face
Won't escape my attention

You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration, could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out
'Til I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire, I'm watching it burn
Yeah, thought of your future
With one foot in the past, now, just how long will it last?
Now, now, now, have you no ambitions? (Mmm, what's the matter with my)
My mother and my brothers used to breathe in clean air 
(Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
And dreaming I'm a doctor 
(Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby)
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand 
(Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
Oh, I feel so

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out
'Til I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four-leaf clover
I'm on the line, one open mind
This is my four-leaf clover

These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know

Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out (let it all out)
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out (break your heart)
These are the things I can do without (I'd really love to break your heart)
Come on
I'm talking to you, come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

Shout, shout, let it all out (they really, really ought to know)
These are the things I can do without (they really, really ought to know)
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on (they really, really ought to know)

Shout, shout, let it all out (break your heart)
These are the things I can do without (I'd really love to break your heart)

'Cause I got a vibe on you the first time that I saw you, whoa...

When the push comes to shove
And you need a little love
Let me put some rock into your world
Call me up don't be shy
For my love will make you high
I just want to be your lovergirlDo you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my babe
I want to tell you how much I love you

Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you just how much I love you

Come with me, to the sea of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my babe
I want to tell you oh how much I love you

Come with me, to the sea of love

Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you just how much I love you

I want to tell you oh how much I love youOut of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time

We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion, their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air

And I wonder when
We are ever gonna change, change
Living under the fear
'Til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light 
Or end in the dark
Is it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond Thunderdome

All the children say
(We don't need another hero)
We don't need another hero
(We don't need to know the way home)
(All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome)Lionel Richie

Just you and meTime can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

Should have known better, yeah
Oh, oh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
(Should have known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?Ah, ha
Oh, yeah
(To work)

Somebody told me
Boy, everything she wants
Is everything she sees
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me
Baby
And now we're six months older
And everything you want
And everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me
Oh

(Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh

La, la, la, la, la)

Somebody tell me
Oh
(Won't you tell me)
Why I work so hard for you
(Give you money
Work to give you money)
Oh

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give-and-take
Well, you've shown me you can take
You've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two

(Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo)
I can't work any harder than I do
(La, la, la, la, la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la)

Somebody tell me
Oh
(Won't you tell me)
Why I work so hard for you
(Give you money)
Oh
(Work)
To give you money
Oh

Oh
Why do I do the things I do
Tell you if I knew
My god
I don't even think that I love you
(La, la, la, la, la)

(Won't you tell me
Give you money
Work to give you money)
Oh

Oh, yeah
Tell me
Tell me

How could you settle for a boy like me
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time
My situation never changes
Walking in and out of that door
Like a stranger for the wages
I give you all
You say you want more

And all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time

(Work, work
Work, work
La, la, la, la, la)
Just a matter of

Oh, please tell me
Why
I do the things that I do

Work to give you money).Everyday I hear a different story
People saying that you're no good for me
"Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you"
Oh
If you loved me baby, you'd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't need your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
Bet you someday baby someone says the same to you

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby you could drag to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

Oh
I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you

Hurting me, baby
Hurting me, baby

Hurting me, baby
Hurting me, baby

But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

I don't want your freedom
I don't need to play around
I don't want nobody baby
Part-time love just brings me down
I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody baby
Part-time love just brings me down

I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
I don't want your
(I don't want your)
Oh...A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist
Being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling, when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night
For feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night 
That I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love, yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For youI found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see 

That you give good love to me baby
So good, take this heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby you give good love

Never stopping, I was always searching
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me baby
So good, take this heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby you give good love

Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not, what this loves all about
Our love is here to stay, stay

That you give good love to me baby
So good, take this heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby you give good loveUh-huh-huh, doo-doo
Bah bah bah-ah-ah

Talking away, ah
No, I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
Oh, I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends, but I'm me
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
"It's no better to be safe than sorry"

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, the things that you say
Yeah, is it life or just to play
My worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
Yeah, you're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone (take on me)
In a day (take me on)
(Take on me)

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
Take on me
Take me onHere we are the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out
It could mess up, both our happy homes

I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
They can never no, oh no, we can't leave a trace

Secret lovers that's what we are, we shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go, oh no, 'cause we love each other so

Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously, alone by the phone

How could something so wrong be so right
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall

Secret lovers that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go, 'cause what we feel is oh so real
So real

You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel, or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time

In the middle of makin' love we notice the time
We both get nervous 'cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful, so that no one will know

Secret lovers, that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is oh so real
So realGoddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no one else had
Wow

In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

Take my breath away
My love
Take my breath away
Oh yeah
Take my breath away (yeah)
My love
Take my breath awaySometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory?
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song 
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Oh, mmm, oh
You're my desire, you take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you, oh

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Oooh, saying I love you
I love youShot through the heart
And you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven and put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A schoolboy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Whoa-oh, you're a loaded gun
Whoa-oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love, oh

Ohh, shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)

(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)
(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)

(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)
(Whoa) You give love
(Whoa) You give love (A bad name)Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's somethin' I just have to say
I don't think I could hide what I'm feelin' inside another day
Knowin' I love you

And I, I'm gettin' too close again
I don't wanna see it end
If I tell you tonight would you turn out the lights and walk away
Knowin' I love you?

I'm gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away, I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man and make you understand, Amanda
I love you

And, I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me to feel this way
I don't wanna lose you

So it may be too soon, I know
The feelin' takes so long to grow
If I tell you today, will you turn me away and let me go?
I don't wanna lose you

I'm gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away, I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man and make you understand, Amanda (Oh, girl!)

You and I, I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie, girl
Tomorrow may be too late

You, you and I, girl, we can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late, ohohoho

And feelin' the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with youYou with the sad eyes

Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize
It's hard to take courage

In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when
I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
And don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow

Can't remember when I last saw you laughing

If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors, true colors
True colors are shining through

I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbowI saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl, I know what to believe 

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up 

In your dream, it's overcast
Rain comes down, moving your way fast
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through, throw yourself on the floor
Oh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up, shape up
You're living on dreamtime (you want to run away)
Whoa-whoa
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
Want to run away, want to run away

I know
I say

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
Shape up
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
You're living in dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in dreamtime, it's hard to carry on, girlI don't care what you say
You can give it away

Your money don't mean much to me.
I've been out on my own
Gonna got it alone now

'Cause that's the way it's got to be.
Ev'rybody tells me how I can beat the odds for now.
Well I've been standing by the fire
But I just can't feel the heat.

Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine.

Looking at me
It's easy to see

You think you know just how I feel.
If you do to me wrong and it won't take me long

Before my restless heart will heal.
I'm looking for a love
Love like mine
They tell me it's so hard to find
But I can feel it in the rhythm of the heartbeat in the street.

Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine
Beating like mine.

Tell me what you feel now without a heartbeat
Tell me is it real now without a heartbeat?

Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat

Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat

Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I'm looking for a heartbeatOh
Yeah yeah, yeah

I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite

With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the key and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (faster)

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares, I hate to sleep alone
I need some company, a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (faster)

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby

She likes to party downThere she goes and knows I'm dying when she says "Who is Johnny?"
Games with names that girl is playing, all she says is "Who is Johnny?"
I tried to understand because I'm people too
And playing games is part of human nature
My heart's in overdrive, it's great to be alive

"Who's Johnny?" she said and smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said, "you know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she said and tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
All right, oh yeah

She makes sure I see her teasing, hear her say "Who is Johnny?"
There's no way today is easy, hear her say "Who is Johnny?"
I really couldn't help but fall in love with her
Her being there has made my life worth living
I knew it from the start, that I would lose my heart

"Who's Johnny?" She said and smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said, "you know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she said and tried to look the other way
Still pretending

"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
Wow-ooh, oh no
"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
Oh no-no-no-no, I don't believe it
"Who's Johnny?" she said and tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away

(Girls like her) Are very special girls
(Girls like her) Don't rest
TillTill you too are a believer
Till you too have caught their fever

Who-who-who
"Who is Johnny?"
There she goes and knows I'm dying when she says
"Who is-who-who is" "Who's Johnny?" She said and smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she says, "you know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she says and tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away

Oh, I can't believe it

"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"
I know this girl is only teasing

"Who's Johnny?"
"Who's Johnny?"

"Who's Johnny?"

"Who's Johnny?"
It isn't love...

Er war ein Punker
Und er lebte in der großen Stadt
Es war in Wien, war Vienna
Wo er alles tat
Er hatte Schulden denn er trank
Doch ihn liebten alle Frauen
Und jede rief:
Come and rock me Amadeus

Er war Superstar
Er war populär
Er war so exaltiert
Because er hatte Flair
Er war ein Virtuose
War ein Rockidol
Und alles rief:

Die Banken gegen ihn
Woher die Schulden kamen
War wohl jedermann bekannt
Er war ein Mann der Frauen
Frauen liebten seinen Punk

Er war Superstar
Er war populär
Er war so exaltiert
Genau das war sein Flair
Er war ein Virtuose
War ein Rockidol

AmadeusWell, I've been waiting
Waiting here so long
But thinking nothing
Nothing could go wrong

Well, now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well, I don't really know her
I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin
You're never quite the same

And now I know
She's got something you just can't trust
And it's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well, she don't like losing
To her it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life
You'll want her just the same

And now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touchNeed I say I love you?
Need I say I care?
Need I say that emotions
Are something we don't share?

I don't want to be sitting here
Trying to deceive you
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
And that's the situation
We've known it from the start

Everytime that I look at you
I can see the future
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?

I watch the world go 'round and 'round
And see mine turnin' upside down

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
'Cause you know I know, baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
We're throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Just a throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Just a-throwing it all away
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)You take my breath away
Love thinks it's here to stay
There's still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true

If you could see what I have seen
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Then I wake up and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care

Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take

You, you take my breath away
Love thinks it's here to stay
Still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true

Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take

Then I wake up and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care

Don't forget me when I'm gone
For heaven's sake
I have loved you for so long
Is loving wrong
So don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
Is loving wrongSpare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees

White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand (shadows where I stand)
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands

I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this (all I remember)
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

Is it cloak and dagger
Could it be spring or fall?
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall

(Weaker in my eyesight) Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip (words that have no form)
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away (further I'm away)

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
(Every single second) Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm awayYou can look at the menu but you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions but you can't have a seat
You can dip your foot in the pool but you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment but you can't commit the sin

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion but you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win
Some break the rules and live to count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit but you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blameI used to be a renegade, I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
'Cause I can tell what's going on

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on TV
I'm working out most every day and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy, I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out, you see it every day
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it, an idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
Tell 'em, boys

Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be a square
Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hip

Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be a square
Here, there and everywhere
It's hip, hip

Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be a square
Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hip

Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be a square
Here, there and everywhere
Hip, hipWe've had some fun
Yes, we've had our ups and downs
Been down that rocky road
But here we are, still around

We thought about someone else
But neither one took the bait
We thought about breaking up
Now we know it's much too late

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We've had our doubts (ooh, wa ooh)
We never took them seriously
And we've had our ins and outs (ooh, wa ooh)
But that's the way it's supposed to be

We thought about giving up (giving up)
But we could never stay away
We thought about breaking up (ooh, wa ooh)
But now we know it's much too late

And it's no great mystery
If we change our minds
Eventually
It's back to you and me

Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends
And the same address

Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes, it's true (yes it's true)
I'm so happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see (I can see)
That you're happy to be stuck with me

I'm happy to be stuck with you
Happy to be stuck with you

He stood me up again.
Again?
Mmm hmm.
Well, what's up with this guy? Do you really like him that much?
Yes, honey, I love him. He is fine, he does a lot of nice things for me.
I know he used to do nice stuff for you, but what has he done for you lately?

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind...
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

Used to go to dinner almost every night
Danced until I thought I'd lose my breath
Now it seems your dancin' feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death...
Ain't that a shame?

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
I'm tellin' you... no way.

You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always puttin' off what we could do today
Soap opera says you've got one life to live
Who's right who's wrong?

What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh ooh ooh yeah

This is wild... I swear.Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get
More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

'Cause then I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
Hee (so in love)
With you (so in love)
(So in love)

When I think of you (when I think of you)
When I think of you (when I think of you)
Bass

I just think of you
If you're not around, I'm
When I think of you

 (So in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby, you (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
With you (so in love)

Hahahaha
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah
BabyNot a word from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain
Night is young, so are we
Let's get to know each other better, slow and easily
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake your body to the music, maybe then you'll score

So come on, baby, won't you show some class?
Why you want to move so fast?

We don't have to take our clothes off (Mmm...)

Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Begging you to touch and go

Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Heading into twilight
Spreading out her wings tonight
She got you jumping off the deck
And shoving into overdrive

Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you right into the danger zone

They'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Oh, yeah!

Out along the edges
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone

Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zoneThought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you
Then I realized
That it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me...

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe (just can't believe)
That we're through...

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
All the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.

I miss you (I miss you...)
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see

I've got to gather my senses together (Together)
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now (over now)
Be strong (be strong)
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.

I miss you (I miss you...)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and dream.What is happening here
Something's going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the lights
We're gonna have a party
It's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people startin' a climb the walls
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Come on!

Everybody start to lose control
When the music is right
If you see somebody hangin' around
Don't get uptight
The only thing we want to do tonight
Is go 'round and 'round
And turn upside down
Come on! Let's get down!

So come on! Let's get loose
Don't hold back
'Cause ain't no use
Hard to keep your feet on the ground
'Cause when we like to party
We only want to get down

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

(Scream, whistles) Say what?
Can't stop now
Just getting started
Everybody clap your hands
Come on
Everybody let's dance

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Baby, baby
We gonna dance all night
Till the broad daylight
Keep on movin', keep on groovin'
Oh yeah
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling...I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you - can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I'd run away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? 
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of mePapa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now, I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart, but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe

Please, Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be alright, it's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice

Please, Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby, mmm

Daddy, daddy, if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love, we are in love

So please, Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby
Ooh, I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh oh

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep

(Papa don't preach) Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby
(Papa don't preach) Ooh
(Papa don't preach) Don't you stop loving me, daddy
(Papa don't preach) I know I'm keeping my babyHey!
What?
Listen

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door

I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby this I know, 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those teardrops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you, 'cause it's

True love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

No no more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby (true love baby)
True love, oh baby, true love it's

True, so if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

No no more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you

I love you (This time I know it's true love)
La la la... (The one I'm dreaming of)
la la la... (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue baby I love you, 'cause it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby (true love baby)
True love, oh baby, true love it's
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby (true love baby)
True love, oh baby, true love it's

True, la la la... (true love baby)I realize you're seeing someone new
I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side,
The one you always try to hide from me.

But I know when you have something on your mind.
You've been trying to tell me for the longest time.
And before you break my heart in two,
There's something I've been trying to say to you.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes,
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry,
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

Your heart has always been an open door
But baby I don't even know you anymore.
And despite the fact it's hurting me,
I know the time has come to set you free.

But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside
And if you look in my eyes,
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry,
And before we say goodbye
I tried to say "I love you"
But the words got in the way

I'm trying to say "I love you"
But the words get in the way.I said "Go if you wanna go
Stay if you wanna stay"
I didn't care if you hung around me
I didn't care if you went away
And I know you were never right
I'll admit I was never wrong
I could never make up my mind
I made it up as I went along

And though I treated you like a child
I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

I never had any time
And I never had any call
But I went out of my way just to hurt you
The one I shouldn't hurt at all
I thought I was being cool
Yeah, I thought I was being strong
But it's always the same old story
You never know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

And if I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a, all I need is a
All I need is you (All I need is a miracle)Kýrie, eléison

The wind blows hard against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gem like flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Kýrie, eléison
Down the road that I must travel
Kýrie, eléison
Through the darkness of the night

Kýrie, eléison
Where I'm going, will you follow?
Kýrie, eléison
On a highway in the light

When I was young, I thought of growing old
Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be

Kýrie, eléison
Down the road that I must travel
Kýrie, eléison
Through the darkness of the night

Kýrie, eléison
Where I'm going, will you follow?
Kýrie, eléison

Whoa, oh, oh

Happiness is so hard to find
Hey baby tell me what is on your mind

'Cause I can't wait
Baby 'til you call me on the telephone

You know I love you even when you don't try
I know that our love can never die
Hey darlin' when you look into my eyes
Please tell me you'll never have to say goodbye

Please don't take my heart away
Promise me, just one more night
Then we'll go our separate ways
We've always had time on our side
Now it's fading fast
Every second, every moment
We've gotta make it last

I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd still be friends someday

If you leave I won't cry
I won't waste one single day
But if you leave don't look back
I'll be running the other way
Seven years went under the bridge
Like time was standing still
Heaven knows what happens now 
You've gotta say you will

I'll touch you once, I'll touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd meet again

I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd still be friends

I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I need you then
You always said we'd meet again someday

If you leave
If you leave
If you leave
Don't look back
Don't look backForever

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables

In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West End town

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what
How much have you got?

Have you got it, do you get it
If so, how often?
And which do you choose
A hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
Ooh, West End town, a dead-end world
East End boys, West End girls
West End girls

You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last

In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)

In a West End town, a dead-end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead-end world
East End Boys, West End girls
West End girls

West End girls

West End girls
(How far have you been?)

Girls
The West End girls
The West End girls
The West End girls
The West End girlsLove, like a road that never ends
How it leads me back again
To heartache
I'll never understand

Darling, I
Put my heart up on the shelf
Till the moment was right
And I told myself

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Oh now
As I look into your eyes
Well, I wonder if it's wise
To hold you like I've wanted to before

Tonight
Ooh, I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life
In this heart of mine

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love

'Cause we're both lying here
There's so many things I wanna say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever 
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

We'll live forever 
Knowing together

From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero that your dreaming of
We're gonna live for ever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever

You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back

All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

Gotta, gotta, gotta

Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world

You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food, yeah

You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kissThe lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes

You can't sleep no, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Oh, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

You see the signs, but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine

I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on

Now I bring you home
You tell me the night's not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on

Whoa, I didn't mean to turn you on

You read me wrong
I wasn't tryin' to lead you on
Not like you think
I didn't mean to turn you on

I know you
Expected a one-night stand
When I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand

I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on

I told you twice
I was only tryin' to be nice
Only tryin' to be nice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on

Hey, now why should I
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give
Guilty 'cause I won't give in?
I didn't mean to turn you on

Whoah, I didn't mean to turn you on

When I took you out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on

Whoa, I didn't mean to turn you on

I didn't mean to turn you on...Run-D.M.C.:
Now there's a backseat lover
That's always under cover
And I talked till my daddy say
"Said ya ain't seen nothin' till your down on a muffin,
And there's sure to be a change in ways"
Now there's a cheerleader
That's a real big pleaser
As far as I could reminisce
And the best thing lovin'
Was your sister and your cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

She starts swingin'
With the boys in school
And her feet was flyin' up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to...

Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith:
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Well just gimme a kiss
Ooh, a-like this!

Run-D.M.C.:
School girl sleezy with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt hangin' way up her knee
There were three young ladies in a school gym locker
And I find there were lookin' at D
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I miss
Then my next door neighbor
Had a daughter, had a favour
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

Aerosmith:
She starts swingin' with the boys in the school

Too good for me

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
That is you

You lift me up
Like the sweetest cup

You lift me up
Don't you ever stop
I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing
'Cause you said
You'll follow through
You follow me
And I, I, I follow you

(What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when the love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tide
What's it gonna take)
To make a dream survive
(Who's got the touch)
To calm a storm inside
(Who's gonna save you)

Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is
Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is
Until your love is
Alive

Oh
You lift me up
To the crucial top
So I can see
Oh
You lead me on
Till the feelings come
And the lights that shine on
But if that don't mean nothing
Like if someday it should fall through
You take me home
Where the magic's from
And I'll be with you

(What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when your love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tides

Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone

Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to neither sooner or later

Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I've known
Holding back the tears
'Cause nothing here has grown

I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah, oh

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
So tight

All right
Oh now

Well, I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all of those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
'Cause nothing ever could, oh yeah, oh

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on

Holding, holding, holding, oh
I say, ooh yeah
That's all I have today
It's all I have to sayI... I... I... I... I... I need, I need you
I... I... I... I... I... I need, I need you

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin' I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burnin' so come on heat my desire
Come on, come on

Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, I need you, I need you
Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come on

People get jealous 'cause we always stay together
Yeah, baby
I guess they really want a love like yours and mine
Together, forever
I never thought that I could ever be this happy
Yeah, baby
My prayers were answered boy, you came in the nick of time
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I've got this feelin' that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was fallin' apart
But now at last I really know that we are

Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, I need you, I need you
Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come on

I... I... I... I... I... I need, I need you

Oh, no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burnin' so come on heat my desire

Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come onGo now
Don't look back, we've drawn the line
Move on
It's no good to go back in time

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings, it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger
In the game when the stakes are high
Branded
My heart was branded while my senses stood by

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings, it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

('Cause Sara) Loved me like no one ever loved me before
(And Sara) Hurt me, no one could ever hurt me more
(And Sara) Sara
(And Sara) Nobody loved me anymore

I'll never find another girl like you
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, oh

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, no

Ooh, Sara
Why did it, why did it
(Sara, Sara)
Why did it all fall apart?
(Sara, Sara)Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
A good kind of love, want a higher love

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

Bring it, oh

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Whoa, bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh (bring me)
Bring be a higher love (whoa)
Bring be a higher love (whoa, bring me a higher love)

Bring me a higher love (I said bring me)
Bring me a higher love, oh (I said bring me)
Bring be a higher love
Bring be a higher love

Bring me a higher love (whoa-oh-oh, bring a higher love)
Bring me a higher love, oh (bring me higher love)
Bring be a higher love (got love, bring me higher love)
Bring be a higher love (with that love, whoa)

Bring me a higher love (I said bring me)
Bring me a higher love, oh (oh yeah, bring me higher love)
Bring be a higher love (higher, higher, higher)
Bring be a higher love

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher loveI can see we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see your expression when the phone rings
We both know
There's something happening here

There's no sense in dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect
Well, don't turn now
There's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Dusty words lying under carpets
Seldom heard, well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside
Hidden deep from view

Do I seem all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well, I've searched through all my cards
Well, isn't that enough?
You can hide your hurt
But there's something you can do

You can talk to me
You can talk to me, when you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me

Though we lay face to face and cheek to cheek
Our voices stray from common ground where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear (tear, tear, tear)

Let the walls burn down
Set your secrets free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here

You can talk to me
Talk to me, when you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Well, I can see that expression when the phone rings
And I can see that we're thinkin' 'bout the same thing
Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, now you've taken all my dreams
Isn't that enough?

Well I can see you, baby (I can see you, baby)
Well I can see you, baby (I can see you, baby)
Talk to me, yeah
Well, I can seeTwo worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash, venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes

Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West, or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

In the burning heart, just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night, rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fire

In the warrior's code, there's no surrender
Though his body says stop, his spirit cries never
Deep in our soul a quiet ember
Knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on

It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack, it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

In the burning heart, just about to burst
There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night, rising like a spire
In the burning heart, the unmistakable fireSix o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream

But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday

Of all of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
"C'mon honey, let's go make some noise."
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)

It's just another manic Monday (oh, oh)
I wish it was Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
It's just a manic MondayCome on baby, dry your eyes
Wipe your tears
Never like to see you cry
Won't you please forgive me?

I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
I just needed someone to hold me
To fill the void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes

So many nights I longed to hold you
So many times I looked and saw your face
Nothing could change the way I feel
No one else could ever take your place

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
Human
Born to make mistakes
(I am just human)
(Human)
(Human)
Please forgive me

The tears I cry aren't tears of pain
They're only to hide my guilt and shame
I forgive you, now I ask the same of you
While we were apart, I was human too

(Human)
(Human)

I'm only human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
(I am just human)
Human
Born to make mistakes

(Human, Human)How did you know, 'cause I never told
But you found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talkin' when she should be listenin'
Can't keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside

I never knew a rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out all over town
That I'm longing for you

How did you know, 'cause I never told
But you found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Maybe I was the one who left the trace
Was there a message written on my face
Were my emotions so easily read
That you would know my thoughts before a word was said

Was it my eye that let you know you had control
Because the way you moved was so self-assured
You knew I would surrender

How did you know, 'cause I never told
You found out I've got a crush on you
No more charades, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

Won't you give me some advice 
On how to handle my private life 
I'm sure we can make a deal 

I confess I'm a fool for men
With a clever mind 
But your intellect ain't no match
For this heart of mine 

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough of to tip the scales 
I'm just using my female attraction 
On a typical male, on a typical male 

Your sense of justice I'll embrace 
But your defense don't help my case 
I'm deep in trouble with the law 

Something about authority 
Seems to bring out the bad in me 
Hey lawyer, gotta catch me when I fall 

Oh, they say that you match your wits
With the best of them 
But I know when I'm close you're just
Like the rest of them

On a typical male, on a typical male 

So put your books aside 
Loosen off the suit and tie 
Gotta open up your heart and let me in 
Open up your heart and let me in

All I want is a little reaction 
Just enough of to tip the scales

On a typical male, on a typical male

Straight from my heart

And only time will tell

Do it with meI believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in loveThere's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Hoo, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me! I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uhh
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

Ooh, tell me, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

If he loves me, if he loves me not, mm
If he loves me, ooh, if he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me, if he loves me not

Oh, how will I know?
Ooh, how will I know?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know?

Hoo, how will I know? (I fall in love)
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know? (I'm asking you)
How will I, how will I...Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings

Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire

Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings, he sings

(Would it be true to say)

Luther croons
Sly's the original originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare
When Smokey sings

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When Smokey sings
Smokey sings
Smokey singsLike a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Mmmm, somehow I made it through the heartache
Yes I did, I escaped, uh-huh
I found my way out of the darkness
Kept my faith
I know you did
Kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waitin'
I knew you were waiting for me, uh-huh

With an endless desire I-I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Light the bridges on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment
No I don't
I know you don't
Looking back, uhh
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh
I know you do
I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, ahh-ah
I knew you were waiting, ahh-ahah
I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny, Ooh boy, Ohh
I know this love we share was meant to be, No-oahh-oh-oh
Knew you were waiting, Woo-Hoo-Ooh-ooh-oooh-wah
Knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me
Oh, I didn't falter
I didn't falter, no
I still believe
When the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Nothing can stop me, no
No way
Knew you were waiting
No I, knew you were waiting for me
I didn't falter
When the mountain was high-gh
I still believe
Oh, when the valley was low
It didn't stop me
Ha, no it didn't stop me, no
Knew you were waiting, stop me
Knew you were, waiting for me, yeah-ah
I didn't falter
Ahhh, Ohhh yeah
I still believe
Oh-oh, I still believe
It didn't stop me
Oh, you know it didn't stop me, no
No-oh
Knew you were waiting
Some day
Some way
Some where
Some how
For me
I didn't falter
When the valley was low
I still believe
I still believe
I believe, I believe
It didn't stop me
An army couldn't stop me
Knew you were waiting
No wayGirl, you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life to you always

A love like yours is grand
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way for always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me, hey

Ooh, you're like is sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
And I will love you so for always

Come with me, my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy for always

Oh boy, I love you so
I can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure I'm yours for always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me, hey

Ooh, you're like is sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
And I will love you so for always

Hey, ooh, you're like is sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
And I will love you so for always

Ooh, ooh
I will love you so for always
Ooh, oohWho needs friends who never show?
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago

I'm just thinking about
Those lonely nights
(I'm just thinking about when I waited)
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out
All my friends were right
('Til I found out, ooh, ooh)
I didn't know you at all

I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it,
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh

Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
Baby, I'm too afraid

So you realise what hurt you made
(So you realise the love)
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
(How can I forgive, ooh, ooh)
It's never gonna be the same

I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it,
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, oohOoh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down
I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside

When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in the wave of love

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

When I feel alone
I reach for you and you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice and it carries me

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven

In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby, I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh baby, do you know what that's worth?

They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me that you
Have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think
I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well

How could I hurt you
When darling I love you
And you know I'd never, never hurt you

What do you think
I would give at this moment
If you'd stay
I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
And kiss the ground that you walk on
If I could just hold you again

I'd fall down on my knees
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on, baby
If I could just hold you

If I, could just hold you
If I, if I could just hold you
AgainNo matter what you think you pulled
You'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know
You won't get through

It's a given L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you, you

No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view
Awaits downtown

You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Let down your guard, honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted (oh, oh, uh)

This is a town where everyone
Is reaching for the top
This is a place where
Second best will never do

It's okay you want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted

Shakedown, breakdown, honey
Just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown, takedown

Not so long ago."

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
Mmm, for love

She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other, and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot!

Ohhh, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk, so tough
Mmm, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers, “Baby, it's okay
Someday"

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other, and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot!

Ohhh, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
(Livin' on a prayer)

Ooh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Ohhh, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Ohhh, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Ohhh, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayerThe song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you've got
Till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh, listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away

Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears as they roll
Roll down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance
Listenin' to the bluegrass band
Takes the chill from the air
Until they play the last song
The bluegrass band
Listen to the bluegrass band

I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind
But there's moments that I find
I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away

Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears as they roll
As she turns to go
Down my face as she turns to go

Runnin' down by the lakeshore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
Played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away
Washing her away once, once again

The boat's steaming in
I watch the sidewheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away

Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll as they roll
Roll down my face as she turns to go
As she turns to go
Down my face as she turns to go

Listen to the tears roll down my face
As she turns, as she turns to go
As she turns to go, as she turns to go
As she turns to go
That would be something
Listen to the rain
Listen to the mandolin rainStanding in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says, "Get a job"

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah, but don't you believe them

Said hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do
Said hey, old man, how can you stand to think that way?
And did you really think about it before you made the rules?
He said, son

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ah, but don't you believe them, yeah

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar, no

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it isI hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away

I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I want to read your mind to know
Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow

Well, I've tried so hard baby
But I just can't see
Oh, what a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh, when out go the lights

I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now, you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand

Oh, we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore our future was bright
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure ofIf you disrespect everybody
That you run into
How in the world do you think
Anybody 'sposed to respect you

If you don't give a heck about
The man with a bible in his hand
Just get out the way and
Let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of gentleman
That wants everything their way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself

If you're walking around thinking
That the world owes you something
'Cause you're here
You're going out the world backwards
Like you did when you first came here

Keep talking about the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand over your mouth
When you cough
That'll help the solution

You cuss around women folk
You don't even know their name
Then you're dumb enough to think
That it makes you a big ol' man

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourself

Respect yourself
Respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good
Ca-hoot na na na oh oh
Respect yourselfTake me as I am
Put your hand in mine now and forever
Darling here I stand, stand before you now
Deep inside I always knew

It was you, you and me
Two hearts drawn together bound by destiny
It was you, and you for me
Every road leads to your door
Every step I take for everyone

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
'Cause I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove

Till there was you, you and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

Do you believe a love could run so strong
Do you believe a love could pass you by
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lotta love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life
'Cause I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

I can't go on (I can't go on)
No, I can't go on

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on
Without somebody, and if I'm on my own

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on, you'll never be alone tonight

'Cause I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, if you could say you love meI've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance

I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing

I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away

I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here

It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side

I'll never forget
The way you look tonight
I never will forget
The way you look tonight

The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red

I love youOoh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

(Call me) Oh, baby now
(Call me) Lean on meThere is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know that they won't win

Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
We know that they won't win

Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now
Don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now
When the world comes in
They come, they come
To build a wall between us
You know that they won't win

Don't let them win
(Hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now)
Hey now, hey now
Don't let them win
(They come, they come)
Don't let them win
(Hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now)Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way
To get out of this

Her diary sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cat's in her cradle
Who would've thought
That a boy like me could come to this?

Oh-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh-oh-oh, whoa

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet
But then blow it again

I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy
One too many times

Oh-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment is gone
I followed my hands, not my head
I know I was wrong

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked awayHere I am
Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend
Just like you think it should be
Did you think I would stand here and lie
While our moment was passing us by
Oh, while I am here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around

Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind
While I bide my time

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around

And I'm waiting for your change of heart
Waiting for your change of heartEverytime I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realized how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free

Now I see I'm up to no good (no, no good)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good (felt good baby)
No I can't remember when

No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Couldn't see how much I missed you (now I do)
Couldn't see how much it meant (ah)
Now I see my world come tumbling down
(Tumbling down my world)
Now I see the road is bent

If I only once could hold you (no, no, no)
And remember how it used to be (ah)
If only I could scold you
And forget how it feels to be free

No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No,
No, no, no, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams


No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No,
No, no, no, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No, no, no, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreamsNo-no-notorious, notorious
No-no-notorious

I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out
Not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgments
Who says they're part of our lives?

You own the money 
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the prophets to justify your reasons
I heard your promise, but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again. No-no-Notorious

Girls will keep the secrets (uh)
So long as boys make a noise
Fools run rings to break up
Something they'll never destroy
Grand Notorious slam (bam)
And who really gives a damn for a flaky bandit?
Don't ask me to bleed about it
I need this blood to survive

You own the money 
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the prophets to justify your reasons
I heard your promise, but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again.

No-no-NotoriousWhen lights go down, I see no reason
For you to cry, we've been through this before
In every time, in every season
God knows I've tried, so please don't ask for more

Can't you see it in my eyes?
This might be our last goodbye
Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet
Again, somewhere, again

I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain?

Can't you see it in my eyes?
This might be our last goodbye (Oh, oh, oh)
Carrie, Carrie, all things they change my friend, whoa
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet, oh yeah

Come home from work late again
Work so hard and never play
I can't wait to take you far away

Got to go (Got to go)
Pressure builds from everyone every day
Get away (Get away)
Come my way (Come my way)

Come go with me, oh
Make you feel alive
This night will last
Everlasting through the time

Take my hand, we'll fly away
To our world that we can find today

The world of nine to five

Two hearts in one
Eternal through the nightThe common road seems just like a dream
It's a mystery to me
Fills me within when we're together
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I -  I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I - will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh

It took so long, well I treasure now,
The love you gave to me
And when you smile, it warms my heart in need
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I - I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return, oh, baby
I - will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

You're taking me to the point of no return
(Oh baby)Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
Big, big love

You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
Big, big love

I wake up alone with it all
I wake up but only to fall

Looking out for love
Big, big love
Just looking out for love
Big, big loveIf I could turn the page
In time, then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand there's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

If I could turn the page
In time, then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little liesAll the time I was searching
Nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
Wondering what I could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice
But no-one listening

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Oh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh I know you're going
But I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all
It may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons for being alone
When I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there
I almost believed you

All this time
I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised
How could I ever forget

Listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else

But listen
You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

You know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deepI must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well, this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
Well, everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
They're losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
And the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well, this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the names we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Stand up and let's start showing (Oh-oh-oh)
Just where our lives are going toThere's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't

There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go

I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO

I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies
I don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I can't take much more girl
I'm losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your... sex

It's natural
It's chemical (Let's do it)
It's logical
Habitual (Can we do it?)

It's sensual
But most of all...
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it's... one on one
One on one

I'm not your father
I'm not your brother

Girl, I've been watching you
From so far across the floor now, baby
That's nothing new
I've watched you so many times before now, baby

I see that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And what it's telling me
And you know, oh girl, that I'm not shy
I'm glad you picked up on my telepathy, now baby

(You read my mind) You know you did
(Girl, I wanna shake you down) Well, oh well
(I can give you all the loving you need) I'm gonna love you
(Come on, let me take you down) Oh, baby
(We'll go all the way to heaven)

Oh, I've been missing you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do?
I can tell you've got your pride now, baby

(Oh) Come to me, well oh well (won't you come to me)
Let me ease your mind, oh babe
I've got the remedy, huh, yes I do
Now give me just a little time

(You read my mind)
(Girl, I wanna shake you down) I wanna rock you down
(I can give you all the loving you need) I'm gonna love you
(Come on, let me take you down) Well, oh well
(We'll go all the way to heaven)

Girl, I've been missing you
And you know, it's funny
Every time I get to feelin' this way
I wish I had you near me
I wanna reach out and touch you

I can't stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me, baby, when I'm holding you
I shake and I shiver when I know your near
Then you whisper in my ear
Oh baby, well, oh well

(You read my mind) You know you did
(Girl, I wanna shake you down) Oh, baby
(I can give you all the loving you need) Aah (Loving you'll need)

Come on, girl, let's start the show (girl, I wanna shake you down)
Aah, yeah (I can give you all the loving you need)
Roses are red and violets are blue
I'm gonna rock this town for you (come on, let me take you down)
Hey, baby (we'll go all the way to heaven)

Come on, sugar, let me shake you down
I'm gonna take you down to the ground
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Come on, baby, whisper in my ear

Come on, sugar, let me shake you down
I'm gonna take you down to the ground
I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
Come on, baby, whisper in my earI hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight
Oh, you don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

Oh ooh oh
'Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone
AloneYou told me you love me
You told me you care

But when I'm around you
It's like I'm not there.
I need a reminder
Something I can see

Something on my finger shines so brightly.

Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

When you go
They stay with me until the end.
Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best
Best friend

When you go
They stay with me until the end.

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Diamonds - love don't come for free.
Don't want your money

Don't want your key

Diamonds - love don't come for free.

They say you need some roses
But roses do die

You gave me some candy
It melted
Nice try.
I'm not that demanding
I have simple taste

I just want a token that can't go to waste - Diamonds.

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Don't you know
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Don't want your money
Don't want your key

Diamonds - love don't come for free.I met a fan dancer
Down in Southside Birmingham
She was running from a fat man
Selling salvation in his hand

Now he's trying to save me
When I'm doing all right
The best that I can

Just another fallen angel 
Trying to get through the night

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher 
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

Coming over the airwaves
The man says I'm overdue
Sing along, send some money
Join the chosen few, hey

Mister, I'm not in a hurry
And I don't want to be like you
All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing Jacob's ladder

All I want from tomorrow
Is to get it better than today

Step by step, one by one
Higher and higher
Step by step, rung by rung
Climbing and climbing

Step by step, one by one
Step by step, rung by rung
Step by step
And step by step
Step by stepThis is a story about control,
My control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready? I am.
'Cause it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

When I was seventeen, I did what people told me
Did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago

I'm in control, never gonna stop
Control - to get what I want
Control - I got to have a lot
Control - now I'm all grown up

First time I fell in love
I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive
I thought it would be easy
But now I know I've got to take...

Control - I got to have a lot
Control - to get what I want
Control - never gonna stop
Control - now I'm all grown up

That's right, I'm on my own,
I'll call my own shots, thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand
And lead you on this dance (control)
'Cause what I've got is because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world
Just wanna run my life
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take...

Control - I got to have a lot
Control - to get what I want
Control - never gonna stop
Control - now I'm all grown up

Free at last, out here on my own
Now control this
That's right, career moves
I do what's right for me
And me wants to groove
Is that okay?

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control (and I love it, that's right)
Control - now I've got a lot
Control - now I'm all grown up

I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't make me lose itThere's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow

When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer

Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile before we go too far

Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together 
We made our very first promise
To love, to share and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Let's wait awhile before it's too late
Let's wait awhile, our love will be great
Let's wait awhile before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love will be greater

You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you

Let's wait awhile, before it's too late
You know, you can't rush love
Let's just take our time
Love's so good - sure I'll love will be there
Slow it down

I promise, I'll be worth the wait.Hasta la vista, baby

You gave me love, you did me wrong
Didn't know what to do
But baby, I'm strong, gonna get over you
A new boy I'm gonna choose, you'll see

My love was true, still you threw it all away
Now other guys will have me, they'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah

Was she hot, did she turn you out?
Curiosity rules my brain
Was she worth my heart? It's torn all apart
Are you going back again? Tell me

But now you're like the rest, unworthy of my best

You seem to know just how I really feel.
'Cause I can't let you go

I need and want you to stay right here with me.
Baby

Listen
Baby: I wanna hold

Too

I wanna make sweet love to you

I wanna be there when you feeling low

Never let you go
No
Casanova.Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come trueHead to toe
I know

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known

Who would have thought that we would become lovers
As friends we were so, so tight
Can't help myself, you make me feel so right
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin'

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
I know

Here today, gone tomorrow
It's possible, but I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

He's different from any boy I know
Body supreme
Bedroom eyes, head back to the side
Please don't be so mean

14 karat love, you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love diamonds are forever
Top to bottom I love you, I will leave you never
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin'

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I've got to kiss you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
You got to know
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
You can't hurry love, you got to take it slow
But my angel, you forget your wings tonight (Heaven up above)
Baby, you got the love

14 karat love, you are my jewel of the Nile
When we make love diamonds are forever
Top to bottom I love you, I will leave you never
I got to, got to, got to tell you, darlin'

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I want to kiss you
From head to toe

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
You got to know
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toe

I think I love you from head to toe
I know

Ooh, baby, I want to kiss you
From head to toe
Ooh, baby, I think I love you
You got to know

Ooh, baby, I think I love you
From head to toeHit the beat now

(Lost in emotion)

Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
Mv dreams haven't yet begun, oh baby

Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
And my love for you, oh I can't conceal

Oh, I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? At least my friends think so

Que sera, que sera
Baby, whatever will be
Que sera, que sera
Between you and me (oh, ho)

Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About the crash you have on me? (ooh)
Maybe I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see

I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend (ooh)
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us

From time to time I wonder what I am in your heart
(Sometimes you make me wonder)
And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it will be cold and dark

I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? At least my friends think so

Que sera, que sera
Baby, whatever will be
Que sera, que sera
(Between you and me) Oh no

Baby, am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
(Just how you feel)
And my love for you, oh I can't conceal
Hit the beat now

(Lost) With my feeling
(Lost) I hit the ceiling
(Lost) With big emotions
(Lost) I can't be dealing

(Lost) I wanna be with you
(Lost) But I don't know how
(Lost) In my heart, babe
I can feel the beat now

(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
We're (lost in emotion)

(Lost) My baby
You know that I'm
(Lost) My baby
(Lost in emotion) My-m-m-my-my baby
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)

I ain't losin' track
Of which way I'm going
Ain't gonna double back, no

Don't want no misplay
Put on no display
An angel? no
But I know my way, oh yeah, oh

I used follow
Yeah, that's true
But my following days are over
Now I just gotta follow through

And I remember what my father said
He said "Son, life is simple
It's either cherry red or
Midnight blue, oh
Midnight blue (oh) oh"

You were the restless one
And you did not care
That I was the trouble boy
Lookin' for a double dare

I won't apologize for
The things I've done and said
But when I win your heart
I'm gonna paint it cherry red

I don't want to talk about it
What you do to me
I can't live without it

And you might think that
It's much too soon
For us to go this far
Into the midnight blue, oh
It's midnight blue (oh) oh

Things could be different
But that'd be a shame
'Cause I'm the one who could feel the sun
Right in the pouring rain

I won't say where
And I don't know when
But soon there's gonna come a day, baby
I'll be back again

Yeah, I'll be back for you
You see, I'm saving up my love

Midnight blue, oh
Into the midnight blue, oh
Another midnight blue, oh
The deepest midnight blue, oh

Into the midnight blue (oh) oh
Midnight blue, oh, oh yeah
Midnight blue, oh
The deepest midnight blue, oh, oh

Into the midnight blueI've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo 'te amo'
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

La la la la la la la
Te dijo 'te amo'
La la la la la la la
Él dijo que te ama

Pa-pa-la-pa-pa pa-pa-pa-pahaaa
Aha, aha-ahaaa
La isla bonita
Ahaa, aha-ahaaa...Watch out!

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want, don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
Too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (c'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key
(Watch out, watch out, watch out)
(Fade...)Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word, get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning 'round and 'round
You can't get off, you try but you can't

Quien es esa niña (Who's that girl?)
Señorita mas fina (Who's that girl?)
Quien es esa niña (Who's that girl?)
Señorita mas fina (Who's that girl?)

You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazon es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

Quien es esa niña (Who's that girl?)
Señorita mas fina (Who's that girl?)
Quien es esa niña (Who's that girl?)
Señorita mas fina (Who's that girl?)

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now

Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning 'round and 'round
You can't get off, you try but you can't

Quien es esa niña (Who's that girl?)
Señorita mas fina (Who's that girl?)
Quien es esa niña (Who's that girl?)
Señorita mas fina (Who's that girl?)

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now
Who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?

In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called 'The Disciples'
High on crack and totin' a machine gun

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
A sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And yet we're sending people to the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June, unh

Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn?

U got the look {x5}Welcome to the big time, you're bound to be a star
Even if you don't go all the way, I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play

No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line
Whoa yeah

The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says, "I love your work, babe, but you're just not what we're looking for."
It's never what, but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow, oh

Take a good look around and you'll find
People trying to mess with your mind

But it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play

No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line

Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
Party is never over
The stars are always shining, doesn't matter if it's day or night

The producer says, "Let me change a line or two."
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you wanna scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living, there ain't no such thing as pride, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play

No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line

(Don't mean nothing) Don't mean nothing
(Don't mean nothing) Oh no, it don't mean nothing
(Don't mean nothing) Oh no, it don't mean nothing
(Don't mean nothing) Don't mean nothing at all

(Don't mean nothing)
(Don't mean nothing)
(Don't mean nothing)
(Don't mean nothing)Another sleepless night I can't explain
Somebody said they heard me call your name
The radio won't let you leave my mind
I know it's over but I don't know why

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Should've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

Well there was no risk that I wouldn't take
And not a promise that I didn't make
All I asked was that you just hold on
Now I'm a wondering what I did wrong

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

I gave you all of my body and soul
Never believing we might lose control
I took my hands off the wheel

I can't remember if the lies were true
It's been a million years since I touched you
Well I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for you

Should've known better
Than to fall in love with you
Now love is just a faded memory
Shoud've known better
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain
And my heart still aches for youGot a job that's okay
But they got me working night and day
Punching in, punching out
Is this really what life's all about?

(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna feel?)
I don't know
(What'cha gonna feel, what'cha gonna do?)
Ooh, won't someone tell me
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna do?)
There's only one thing left to say
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna say?)

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)

Baby's gone, all alone
Are you sad because you're on your own?
Get that girl, party down
There's so many good ones still around

(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna feel?)
I don't know
(What'cha gonna feel, what'cha gonna do?)
Ooh, won't someone tell me
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna do?)
I guess there's just one thing to say
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna say?)

Now sing it

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes

Sometimes
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes

(That's life)Full moon in the city
And the night was young
I was hungry for love
I was hungry for fun

I was hunting you down
And I was the bait
When I saw you there
I didn't mean to hesitate

This is the night
This is the night
This is the time we've got to get it right

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now

Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy?
Didn't I treat you right?
You made me feel so good
Made me feel myself
Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else

This is the night, yeah
This is the night
This is the time we've got to get it right

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now

Hot and cold emotions confusing my brain
I could not decide between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night
I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to

Uh...
Uh, it's begging for you

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the time

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heart beat next to mine
(This is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the timeLooking in your eyes
I see a paradise
This world that I found
Is too good to be true

Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you
This love in my heart
That I'm feeling for you

Let them say we're crazy
I don't care 'bout that
Put your hand in my hand, baby
Don't ever look back

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Oh, no, I'm so glad I found you
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes
I will stay here with you

Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes
Is what I'm gonna do

Let them say we're crazy
What do they know?
Put your arms around me, baby
Don't ever let go

Let the world around us
Just fall apart
Baby, we can make it
If we're heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us

Ooh, all that I need is you
All that I ever need
And all that I want to do
Is hold you forever, forever and ever, hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Nothing's gonna stop us, ooh, whoa, oh)

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Nothing's gonna stop us now, oh, no, oh)

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Hey, baby, ah, no, oh, hey, baby)

And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
(Nothing's gonna stop us, hey, baby, ooh, ooh)
Nothing's stop

We can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
(Hey, baby, nothing's gonna stop us now, yeah)My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes, I think you've seen me before

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

I think it's 'cause I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

They only hit until you cry
After that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
Just don't argue anymore
Just don't argue anymore

Yes, I think I'm okay
I walked into the door again
If you ask that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway

I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am

My name is Luka
I live on the second floor
I live upstairs from you
Yes, I think you've seen me before

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

And they only hit until you cry
After that you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
Just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymoreSomething in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul
The tear in my heart as you walk on by
(More than an ocean)
I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do convinces me more
(Keeps us apart)
Please, give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face
(I feel a tearing in half of my heart)
I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race
You move in a way that I've known before
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Tired eyes, tears that dried
(Leaving you ain't easy now)
On the bed, on the pillow, where the love has died
(Loving you's the harder part)
A turn of the key, through the door you go
(You never want me for myself)
Don't look back, to hurt me more
(Now I've needed you right from the very start)
Everything you said was to the point
Can't you try to (oh won't you even try to)

Give a little bit of heart and soul
(Give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
(Give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more
(Must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul

Walking on the water, walking on the air
(A walk on the water)
That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold
(Is all that I need)
Can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover with a Midas touch
(But miracles are not happening)
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now give me love, heart and soul

Tired eyes, tears that dried
(Living in a fantasy)
On the bed, on the pillow, where you told your lies
(There's never any room to breathe)
A turn of the key, my blood runs cold
(Hoping every waking hour)
Don't look back to hurt me more
(You'll turn around and say that we can start)
Everything you did just said it all
Can't you try to (oh won't you even try to)

Give a little bit of heart and soul
(Give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
(Give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more
(Must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul

Somehow, I lost my way
Looking to see something in your eyes
But love will never compromise
Now this is the politics of life, yeah!

Give a little bit of heart and soul
(Give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul
(Give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more
(Must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit, little bitAll the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick (oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an EgyptianI got a little change in my pocket going ching-a-ling-a-ling
Wanna call you on the telephone, baby, give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"
My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

Ooh, baby, baby, baby, why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy, I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"
My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love, started talking about sin
I said, "Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said, "No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"
My honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"I, I was a game he would play
He brought the clouds to my day
Then like a ray of light
You came my way one night

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
Put all your fears to rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all over him

No, don't let him worry you so
Once I met you I let go
Oh, you can surely see
You're so much more to me

Just one look and I knew
You would make everything clear
Make all the clouds disappear
You're better than all the rest
Who do I love the best?
Don't you know, don't you know

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him

You got it all over him
You got me over him
Honey it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven-sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb
And you're all that he's not
Just look what I got
'Cause you got it all, all over him

Honey, it's true, there's just you
You must have been heaven sent
Hearing me call you went out on a limb...Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Listen
I'm in heaven
Listen

Pay attention, are you listening
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with Cupid
The picture's very clear

Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this groove
(All I need is just me and you)
Just a way to tell you
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
(Don't you)
Don't disturb this groove

Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election, sheer perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change

Baby, over and over
The passion starts again
You're my lollipops and everything
With a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from heaven
And the day the earth stood still

Hang the sign up on the door
It says don't disturb this groove
(All I need is just me and you)
Just a way to say to tell you
(I'm so into love)
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
(Don't you)
Don't disturb this groove

(All I need is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you
(I'm so into love)
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
(Don't you)
Don't disturb this groove

When it feels so real
Don't disturb this groove
Ooh-ooh-ooh...

Close your eyes
And let the music put you in a mood
Can you feel it
Uh-huh
(Uh-huh)

Ooh, baby, just lock the door
And turn the phone off
It's time, it's time
For me and you
Are you ready

Hang the sign up on the door
I say don't disturb this groove
(All I need is just me and you)
Just a way to tell you
(I'm so into love)
That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
(Don't you)
Don't disturb this groove

(All I need is just me and you)
'Cause I want to tell you

That I'm so into you
(Just so that I'm understood)
And the feeling's so real
(Don't you)
Don't disturb this groove
(I'm so into love)
(All I need is just me and you)
'Cause I need you, baby
I need you, baby
(Just so that I'm understood)
I need you
(Don't you, don't disturb this groove)

'Cause I need you, baby
I need you, baby
(It's just me and you, yes)
Oh, baby, I need you
(And it's understood)
When the feeling's so real
(Don't you)
Don't disturb this groove

'Cause we're grooving baby
We're grooving baby
And I love it, baby
(It's just me and you)
And I love it, baby, love it, baby
Love it, baby
(And it's understood)
When I, when I
(Don't you, don't disturb this groove)
Whoo-ooh-ooh...Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doin'
'Cause what would they say
If they ever knew?

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now (alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now (alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

Running just as fast as we can
Holdin' on to one another's hand
Tryin' to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now (alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now (alone now)
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now (alone now)
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

I think we're alone now (alone now)I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
This burning desire.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of all my shame
All my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She's got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

Oh, oh, oh

With or without you
With or without you, oh
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you

Ooh
OohI'll drive a million miles
To be with you tonight
So if you're feeling low
Turn up your radio
The words we use are strong
They make reality
But now the music's on
Oh, baby, dance with me, yeah

Rip it up, move down
Rip it up, move it down to the ground
Rip it up, cool down
Rip it up, don't hang me on the borderline

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun

Deep in the world tonight
Our hearts beat safe and sound
I'll hold you so close
Just let yourself go down

Rip it up, move down 
Rip it up, move it down to the ground 
Rip it up, cool down
Rip it up, get out what's inside of you

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight (everybody)
Everybody have fun

On the edge of oblivion
All the word is Babylon
And all the love and everyone 
A ship of fools sailing on

(Everybody)
Everybody have fun tonight
(Everybody)
Everybody have fun tonight

Across the nation, around the world
Everybody have fun tonight
A celebration, so spread the word

Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone (can you tell me what a Wang Chung is?)
Everybody, everyone

Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight 
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun

Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyone
Everybody, everyoneI don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises in the songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again
Here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go

'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk aloneRemember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it once again
We can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of me and you

We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall, my friend
Loving you makes life worth living

Didn't we almost have it all
The nights we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all

Didn't we almost have it allClock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done all right up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance with me baby
Don't ya wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't ya wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me
DanceI'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light

Baby
You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right

Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love, I'm nothin' but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do, I'm sleepin' in this bed alone

Baby
You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give when I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why

Baby, baby, baby
You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right

You're my angel, come and save me tonight
You're my angel, come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonightWhen I'm with you, I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up
My tongue is tied
It's crazy
Can't walk; can't talk
Can't eat; can't sleep
Oh I'm in love
Oh I'm in deep
'Cause baby

With a kiss you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak
I get weak

Romantic eyes, persuasive lips
The helpless heart just can't resist their power
You know you've got a hold of me
You know you've got me where I want to be
'Cause lover
Like a wave you keep pulling me under
How I'll ever get out of this, I don't know
I just know that there's no way to fight it
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I'm in deep when I look in your eyes
I get weak

I get weak!
I get weak!

Just a kiss you can strip me defenseless
Just a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
Weak - when we touch
I can't speak when I look in your eyes
I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyes

I get weak when you're next to me
Weak - from this love
I can't speak when I look in your eyesYour love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

(Bad medicine)

I ain't got a fever, got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money, but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count 'em one, two, three

First you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug, oh oh oh

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine

I don't need no needle to be givin' me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, that doesn't leave a track
I got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic, gonna save this heart attack

When you need (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little and it's never enough)
And when you're on your knees (That's what you get for fallin' in love)
Now this boy's addicted 'cause your kiss is the drug, oh oh oh

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine
Ow, is what I need

I need a respirator 'cause I'm runnin' out of breath
Oh, you're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine, you'll take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better, baby, well they haven't found it yet, oh oh oh

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease

Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease

Bad, bad medicine
Is what I want
Bad, bad medicine

I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hold on, I'm not done
One more time, with feeling
Come on
Alright, help me out now

Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh oh oh, shake it up just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease

Your love, bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love, bad medicineI hear your name whispered on the wind
It's a sound that makes me cry
I hear a song blow again and again
Through my mind and I don't know why

I wish I didn't feel so strong about you
Like happiness and love revolve around you
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

So many people love you baby
That must be what you are

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

I've learn to feel what I cannot see
But with you, I lose that vision
I don't know how to dream your dream
So I'm all caught up in the superstition

I want to reach out and pull you to me
Who says I should let a wild one go free
Trying to catch your heart
Is like trying to catch a star

But I can't love you this much baby
And love you from this far

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeah

Waiting (however long)
I don't like waiting
(I'll wait for you)
It's so hard waiting
(Don't be too long)
Seems like waiting
Makes me love you even more

Waiting for a star to fall
And carry your heart into my arms
That's where you belong
In my arms baby, yeahAs I watch you move, across the moonlit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow I must leave, the dawn knows no reprieve
God give me strength when I am leaving...

So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday

Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

As we move to embrace, tears run down your face
I whisper words of love, so softly
I can't believe this pain, it's driving me insane
Without your touch, life will be lonely

So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday

Tonight, I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight, you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

Morning has come, another day
I must pack my bags and say goodbye...
Goodbye...Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart is not always there
What more can I say to you?

Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know I should make a move
What more can I say?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yes, I know of the harm I do
What more can I say to you?

Now I hold this line
I know the choice to leave is mine
I can't help what I feel inside
What more can I say?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

I'll follow through, I'll say I do
When the time is far more right for you
I'll make that move, and when I do
Will I doubt again, the way I do?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

Just won't give me reasons
Just won't give me reasons at all

How can I fall, I fall, I fall?
How can I fall for you?

How can I fall, how can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasonsSometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Deep in the woods down the low valley road

While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone

Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, on the valley road

Standing like a stone on the old plantation
The rich old man would have never let him in
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
When it all happens, nobody wins

Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on alone, aloneWell you know I can be found
Sitting all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please forget the past
The future's bright ahead
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over and love me
You know I want you to stay
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Let's walk down to the preacher
Let's say "Hey, I do"
And then I know you'll want me
And you'll know I want you too

But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't need no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Don't stop thinkin' of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over and love me
You know I want you to stay
But don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Why should we be apart?
Baby, you know I love you, cross my heart

Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinkin' ofAnother night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me

I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

Watching shadows move across the wall
I feel so frightened
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning

Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone 
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone 
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
And whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Oh, whatever you want, I'll give it to youThought it wouldn't matter
If we didn't stay together
And if it was over
Baby, it was for the better
I was thinking I'd be all right
'Til I thought it all through
Now I know that I ain't really living
If I have to live without you

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you
With you

Guess I had to go away
So much I had to go through
Guess I had to lose you
To realize how much I love you
Can we make the fires burn again?
Burn a little stronger
'Cause I've been alone, and baby
I can't be alone any longer

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you

If I had to make it on my own
My life would never be the same
My love would never be the same
And I don't wanna live without your love

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone (I don't wanna live)
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else (Don't wanna love nobody else)
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you (Live my life with you)When you called me up this morning
Told me 'bout the new love you found
I said: "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"

Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby, ohoho

And from what you said
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be

So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby I can take the news okay

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

And if we meet on the street someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be

I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, ohoho

I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you

I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

If we meet on the street someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

And if we meet on the street someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When you called me up this morning
Told me 'bout the new love you found
I said: "I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you"There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover

But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you

I could never love again the way that I loved you
Oh, I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

Oh, when I was sorry
It was too late to turn around (turn around)
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart

I could never love again the way that I loved you
Oh, I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart)
I could never love again now that we're apartWithout you, without you
I always thought that
Ev'rything was fine
Without you
Never knowing you'd be mine

Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was,
What love was

I need you, I need you
And ev'ry day I love you 
More and more
Without you
I know what it's all for

Suddenly I see you there
And ev'rything's okay
Don't know why I feel this way

Now it's you
Out of the blue
Love appeared
Before my eyes with you
Dream come true
I never thought I'd realize
What love was, what love was,
What love was
Here with youShake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

I'm under a spell again
Boy I'm wondering why
This is not a game of love but an emotional tie
I'm trying to figure out my heart (heart...)
But I can't offer you proof
Of why we should never be apart
And that is the (that is the) that is the truth
Oh...

Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

Do you know why I stop and stare
And smile when you walk by
And how I call you up at night
I hang up the phone and I cry
If I never got to know you so well (I knew you well)
Maybe I would be fine
Baby you know that I can't tell
Why you should be (you should be) you should be mine oh

Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love
Shake your love
I just can't shake...
Shake your love
I just can't shake your love

Ooh I know what you're thinking
I see it in your eyes
You want to give our love another try
I'm so glad you realize I can't...

Shake your love

Shake your love

Watch out, love bites

When you make love
Do you look in your mirror?
Who do you think of?
Does he look like me?

Do you tell lies
And say that it's forever?
Do you think twice
Or just touch and see?

Ooh babe
Ooh yeah

When you're alone
Do you let go?
Are you wild and willin'
Or is it just for show? ooh, come on

I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it, no

(Love bites, love bleeds) It's bringin' me to my knees
(Love leaves, love dies) It's no surprise
(Love begs, love pleads) It's what I need

When I'm with you
Are you somewhere else?
Am I gettin' through?
How do you please yourself?

When you wake up
Will you walk out?
It can't be love
If you throw it about, ooh babe

I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh

(Love bites, love bleeds) It's bringin' me to my knees
(Love leaves, love dies) It's no surprise
(Love begs, love pleads) It's what I need

Oh yeah, I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it
No!

(Love bites, love bleeds) It's bringin' me to my knees
(Love leaves, love dies)

(Love bites, love bleeds) It's bringin' me to my knees
(Love leaves, love dies) It's no surprise
(Love begs, love pleads) It's what I need

If you've got love in your sights
Watch out, love bites
Yes, it does
Bloody hellStep inside, walk this way
You and me, babe, hey, hey

Love is like a bomb, baby, come and get it on
Living like a lover with a radar phone
Looking like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man (be your man)

Razzle and-a dazzle and-a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little Miss-ah Innocent, sugar me
Yeah, yeah

C'mon
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

(Pour some sugar on me) Ooh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) C'mon, fire me up
(Pour your sugar on me) I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

Listen
Red light, yellow light, green-a light, go
Crazy little woman in a one-man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up (loosen up)
Loosen up

You gotta seize a little, squeeze a little, tease a little more
Easy operator, come a-knocking on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little Miss Innocent sugar me
Yeah, yeah

Give a little more
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up

(Pour some sugar on me) Ooh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) C'mon, fire me up
(Pour your sugar on me) Ooh, I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet
From my head to my feet, yeah

You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
Cause I'm hot (hot), say what, sticky sweet
From my head (head, head) to my feet
Do you take sugar
One lump or two

(Take a bottle ) Take a bottle
(Shake it up) Shake it up
(Break the bubble) Break it up
(Break it up) 

(Pour some sugar on me) Ooh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) C'mon, fire me up
(Pour your sugar on me) Oh, I can't get enough

(Pour some sugar on me) Oh, in the name of love
(Pour some sugar on me) Get it, come get it
(Pour your sugar on me) Ooh
(Pour some sugar on me) Yeah hey, sugar meI don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care 'cause you've got something I can share

Hey, take a chance, even if it's only
Only while we're dancing in the 
Light of your second sight because
When you understand me 
You might feel good around me now.

I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around

I won't turn you out if you've got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realise
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination
(Now back it up)

I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around

Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)

I like noise 'cause I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down. I can't shut my mouth
But when you understand me,
You might feel good around me
(Now back it up)

I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)

Your rhythm is the power to move me
It's something you control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
(I don't want your love)

(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love to bring me down
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)

I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(Rhythm)
I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(The rhythm is the power)

I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(Rhythm)
I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(The rhythm is the power)

I don't want your love
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
To bring me down
(Rhythm)
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)
(The rhythm is the power)

I don't want your love
(I don't want your love, I don't want your love)I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

Oh if you wanna spread it around sister that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines
If you wanna hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light

And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that
No I don't wanna go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that

I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna go on with you like that
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna go on with you like that
Come on, come onI've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine  tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I wanna hold you so hear me out
I wanna show you what love's all about
Darlin' tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did i take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be.

I got Hungry EyesI run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of green when the noon sun appears, oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car, she's playin' "Uptown" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close, the way they did long ago...

My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

We put the top down on the car, with the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like the fire in July, oh yeah
Jennifer's singin' "Stand By Me", and she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good, or could this be just the start?

My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

"Be My Baby" comes on and we're movin' in time
And the heat from your touch makes me feel like I'm losin' my mind, oh yeah
(And then they play) "Back In My Arms Again"
(We close our eyes) we start rememberin' when
(We start to kiss) and now the feeling's intense,
And we just pray that this night never ends

My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

Baby, baby
Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

Baby, baby
Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose controlSome dreams are in the night time
And some seem like yesterday
But leaves turn brown and fade
Ships sail away
You long to say a thousand words but
Seasons change

It feels like it's forever
No reason for emptiness
But time just runs away (time runs away)
No more day by day
You dream again, it seems in vain when
Seasons change

(I want you) I want to feel you by my side
(I need you) Don't you know I need you, baby?

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change, people change)
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today

Forever seems so far away
There's time for love and for play
You dream about today (about today)
Feeling slips away
The winds that blow, they go away and
Seasons change

(I want you) Don't hide your feelings from inside
(I need you) I've got to have your love now, baby

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change, people change)

(I want you) I want to feel you by my side
(I need you) I've got to have your love now, baby

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change, people change)
I'll sacrifice tomorrow
Just to have you here today
Just to have you here today

(Seasons change, feelings change)
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
(Seasons change) Seasons change
(People change) People change

(Seasons change) Seasons change
(Feelings change) Feelings change
Change the season
(Seasons change, people change)
(Seasons change, feelings change)I find myself in a strange situation
And I don't know how
What seemed to be an infatuation
Is so different now
I can't get by if we're not together
Ooh can't you see
Girl, I want you now and forever
Close to me

I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
Hoping that you will promise to be mine
And never go away

I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love

I ask myself but there's no explanation
For the way I feel
I know I've reached the right destination
And I know it's real

I'm longing for the time
I'm longing for the day
When I'll be giving you this heart of mine
Believe me when I say

I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love

No I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never live without you
Live without your love

No I don't want to live without you
I don't want to live without you
I could never be without you
Be without your love

I don't want to live without you
Live without your love
Live without your love
You see I'm lost without your love

Ooh... oh
Without your loveI got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right, child

I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

And this time I know it's real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

I got my mind set on you
(Set on you)
I got my mind set on you
(Set on you)

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right

I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

And this time I know it's real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

It's gonna take a-time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

(Set on you)

(Set on you)
(Set on you)

Set on you
Set on you
(Set on you) I got my mind on you
I got it set on youWell, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes, I gotta have faith
Mm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I'll just have to wait
Because I got to have faith

I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I've just got to have faith)
Oh, oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

'Cause I gotta have faith
Mmm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faithThat's all I wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your eyes

For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, whoa

That's all you wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your life

Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, whoa baby

I will be your father figure (oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine (I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher (be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind (it would make me)

I will be your father figure (very happy)
I have had enough of crime (please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime

That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue-eyed shine

This time I think that my lover
Understands me (understands me)
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong, baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine (my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be

So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried

Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes
Baby, baby
And love can't lie, no

(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always telling me so
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
And won't let you go, my baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
And I have had enough of crime
So I am gonna love you
Till the end of time

(I will be your father) I will be your
(I will be your preacher) Father
(I will be your father) I'll be your daddy, whoa
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of timeYou are far, when I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind
Till you listen to your heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them
Steal your heart from you
People, Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So good-bye, but please don't take my heart

You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them, steal your heart

And people, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

But remember this, every other kiss
That you ever give, long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you, like I always do
There's something there, that can't compare
With any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too
I guess you were kissing a fool

You must have been kissing a foolWhy can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye, uh-huh)

Oh, I count to ten 
But I don't know how and I don't know when 
To open my eyes 
If you kiss me again
Like you did just now, like you did just then

I've had the rest
Now it's time I had the best
So you tell me that you won't do anymore

Well I'd write your heart a letter
But I think you know me better
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe I'll get what I'm askin' for

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving in to it
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it? 
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)

Oh I hate your friends 
But I don't know how and I don't know when 
To open your eyes 
Yes the monkey's back again 
Do you want him now like you did back then? 

I tried my best
But your head is such a mess
So I guess that I don't want you anymore

Well you say you care about me
That you just can't do without me 
But you keep on dancin' baby 
Till that monkey has you on the floor

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)

Don't look now, there's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now, there's a monkey on your
Don't look now, there's a monkey on your back 
Don't look now, there's a monkey on your

So you tell me that you won't do anymore

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)

Why can't you do it?
Why can't you set your monkey free?
Always giving into it
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?

Why can't you do it?
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey? 
(With a monkey, with a monkey, aye, aye, aye)I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace

Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry

So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat

That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me, know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh, the last one I had made me cry

So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride

Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Because there ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more tryAnything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years

Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbyeShe's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Oh oh yeah
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah
Ooh, sweet love of mine

(Where do we go?)
(Where do we go now?)
(Where do we go?)

Ooh, where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Oh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Mm, where do we go now?
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye (Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Ahh, where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Ooh, where do we go now?
Now now now now now now now
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mineEverybody's looking for the perfect world
Where you could have everything your heart desires
The perfect boy will meet the perfect girl
And the perfect love will set the world on fire

Well what you gonna do, when one and one makes three
And a vision of the future is impossible to see
Nobody's perfect, not even a perfect fool
If you'll have faith in me
I'll keep faith with you

Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
There ain't no perfect world anyway
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world

Everybody's got secrets, now you know that it's true
They talk about me and they'll talk about you
Something happens to the pledges of trust
Down through the years they begin to rust

Now here we are amid the tears and the laughter
Still waiting for our happily ever after
We'll keep on dreamin' as long as we can
Try to remember and you'll understand

Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
There ain't no perfect world anyway
Ain't no livin' in a perfect world
But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world
Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect worldHere come the woman

Sharper than knives

Other half die

But full of pride 

Look at them go

I wanna know 
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know 
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

Pure energy
Pure energy

Here I am in silence
Looking 'round without a clue
I find myself alone again
All alone with you

I can see behind your eyes
The things that I don't know
If you hide away from me
How can our love grow? 

I wanna know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I wanna know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind

But what good would it do?

You and I in silence
With nothing else to say

Tell me what's on your mindSo much for your promises
They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it was just too late to know
I thought it was you
Who would stand by my side

And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

You said you'd die for me

Woke up to reality
And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things could work out right
I thought it was you
Who would do me no wrong

And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

You've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away

Oh, no, no, no
You said you'd die for me

Oh, for
Die for me

So much for your promises

So much for your promisesSeen you last night, say you standin' there
Couldn't picture the color of your hair
All I wanted to know were you really there
I wanna know was it my imagination
Ooh, you know it was a sweet sensation
Lookin' at you from a distance
Ooh, it seems so real

You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real all I know is

So take your weight off of me 
I know your every move 
So won't you just let me be 
I've been here times before 
But I was too blind to see 
That you seduce every man 
This time you won't seduce me 

She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you please 
I have the stuff that you want 
I am the thing that you need 
She looked me deep in the eyes 
She's touching me so to start 
She says there's no turning back 
She trapped me in her heart 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be!

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the band 
She knows when they come to town 
Every musician's fan 
After the curtain comes down 
She waits at backstage doors 
For those who have prestige 
Who promise fortune and fame 
A life that's so carefree 

She's saying that's ok 
Hey baby do what you want 
I'll be your night loving thing 
I'll be the freak you can taunt 
And I don't care what you say 
I want to go too far 
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

Dirty Diana, nah

She said I have to go home 
'Cause I'm real tired, you see 
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight 
I didn't call on the phone 
To say that I'm alright 

Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Saying "baby, I'm alright"
I said but unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me 

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come onI'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...

As I, turn up the collar on my
Favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone

A widow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed - out dream
(Washed - out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways - ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that...
Change!

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror - oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
(You gotta get it right, while
You got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your... your mind!
(Then you close your... mind!)

That man
(With the man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Na na na, na na na, na na na nah
(Oh yeah!)
Gonna feel real good now!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Na na na, na na na, na na na nah

(Ooooh...)
Oh no, no, no...
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on
(Change...)

Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
I've got to make that change
Today!
Hoo!
(Man in the mirror)

You got to
You got to not let yourself...
Brother...
Hoo!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
You know - I've got to get
That man, that man...
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move!
Come on! Come on!
You got to
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
Stand up and lift yourself, now!
(Man in the mirror)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Aaow!
(Yeah, make that change)
Gonna make that change...
Come on!
(Man in the mirror)
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know...
(Change...)
Make that changeHee! - hee!
Ooh!
Go on girl!
Aaow!

Hey pretty baby with the high heels on 
You give me fever 
Like I've never, ever known 
You're just a product of loveliness 
I like the groove of your walk, 
Your talk, your dress 
I feel your fever from miles around 
I'll pick you up in my car 
And we'll paint the town 
Just kiss me, baby 
And tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be working from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet

(My lonely days are gone)
Acha - ooh!

Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!
Go on girl!

I never felt so in love before
Promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me...

The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
now baby - hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

The way you make me feel

You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
now baby - hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

Ain't nobody's business,
ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business,
Ain't nobody's business but
mine and my baby
(You really turn me on)
Hee hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
Hee hee! Ooh!
(My lonely days are gone)

Give it to me - give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl - I wanna
be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business but
mine and my baby's
Go on girl! Aaow!
(My lonely days are gone)

Hee hee! Aaow!
Chika - chika
Chika - chika - chika
Go on girl! - Hee hee!
(The way you make me feel)
Hee hee hee!
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone)

(The way you make me feel)
(You really turn me on)
(You knock me off of my feet)
(My lonely days are gone)You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do

Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts

Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that

I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do 
There in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well, now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong

Well, they tempt you, man, with silver 
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures 
That flesh does surely hold

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that

I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing
In the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now, now, now, some folks say it's too big 
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast

Oh, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (that too)
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do

Anyway we don't have to drive it 
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there
In the back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean, Le Car
Woah! CadillacTo believe
Or not to believe
That is the question
It takes a street degree
You've lied your last lie
And I've cried my last cry
I'm out the door, babe
There's other fish in the sea

Girl, make a list
Go out and find yourself a new play thing
Girl, you need a trip
'Cause he's not worth the misery and pain
Just remember how he would tell you lies
And then pretend that everything is so sweet
Why should you sacrifice
If he's not satisfied
He's just a canine runnin' 'round in heat

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the best he ever had, oh, oh, oh
(OH Girlfriend)

How could you let him (treat ya treat ya treat ya) so bad. OH
Girlfriend
You know you were the (best he ever had), oh, oh, oh

Girl, you must resist
Don't let him squirm his way into your heart
No, girl, I must insist
You've got to stop the thought before he starts
Just remember how he was so untrue
And all the tacky things he did to you
No need to signify
'Cause he's not worth your time
You need to find someone that's true to you (TRUE TO YOU)

Girlfriend
How could you let him treat you so bad, oh
Girlfriend
You know you were the (best he ever had), hay oh, oh, oh
Girlfriend
How could you let him treat so bad (treat ya, treat ya) baby don't be sad, now.

Hey Deal - sing
To believe

Quite as good as I should

Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time

You were always on my mind

spoken:
Hehe, stop the car. I'm getting out
You are no longer here
Stop. Go
Go! Go!
You went away
It should make me feel better
But I don't know how I'm going to...
Do I have any weapons?
Why, what do you need?
Do I have any weapons?
Why, what do you need?I am so in love with you
I just can't deny it

You can read me like a book
Just like a fortune teller
Everybody needs a fortune teller
Telling you the very truth 

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do 

You bring out the best in me
With love and understanding
Anytime I need some understanding
You are always there 

And if I ever lose my way
You're always there to guide me
Anyone can see you're here inside me
Anyone can see it 

You bring me feelin'

You fill me with hope
Love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do 

This is our time, we have it all
We have a way of knowing if we're heading for a fall
We'll work it out and get it right
And when I get home to you
You're such a sight for my poor eyes 

This is our time, we have it all
When I come home at night
You're such a sight for my poor eyes 

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do 

You fill me with hope
Love and devotion

RepeatWhen I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me, I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear

Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love

Any time you want to, you can turn me on to
Anything you want to, any time at all
When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside

Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love, oho

When I'm feeling blue, all I have to do
Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care

Wouldn't you agree, baby you and me, we've got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love, we've got a groovy kind of love
Oho, we've got a groovy kind of loveSummer came and left without a warning
All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights (Oh I remember)

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nightsJust when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for a while
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise?
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise

What happens now?
Do we break another rule? Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Well, I think I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free
Everytime I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I'm wishing I could give you more

Oh
Hold on to the nightsOoh

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)

Better not pass me by
'Cause if you do you'll lose a good thing (oh baby)
'Cause what I've got to say is sealed with a kiss and a wedding ring (wedding ring)
My mind is blind at times I can't see any one but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view

Naughty girls need love too." 

I've been told time and time again 
That you can't treat love like a game 
But I play rough with hearts that never mend 
'Cause some guys like you do the same 
Love was just a four letter word 
Never heard how absurd it could be 
But now I can't believe this is real 
How I feel now you steal 
My heart away from me 

Used to be so good and so bad 
Sex was something I just had
Used to always know what to do 
Now you've got me confused 

Baby don't let me be misunderstood 
Temporary love's so bad but if feels so good 
Then along came you 
Now I know its true 
Naughty girls need love too 
Then came you, then came you 

Yes, it's true 
I'm in love with you 
And believe it baby this time 
Your love won't get away 
Stay here in the place to be 
We can get busy my way 
For six forevers and a day-ay-ay 
Ooh it's only you I adore 
So much more than my body 
Was asking for 
Yes your love is breaking my chill 
Even still there's a thrill 
In my heart.

Until the end of timeFortunately you have got someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in
The symptoms are so deep
It's so much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play
I'd rather be in hell with you baby
Than in cool heaven, it seems to be the way

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines bright
On a peaceful day

Stranger blue leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you, makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love, and the earth rotates to our dictates
Slowly we make love...

Sign your name across my heart...Kissing like a bandit, stealing time
Underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid by the hour sends valentines
To my sweet lover and me

Slowly, but surely
Your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly
I'm falling in love with you

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Sing

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do
Right beside a riverboat gambler, hahahaha
Erotic images float through my head
Say you wanna be a midnight rambler

Quickly, but quickly
The blood races through my veins
Quickly, loudly
I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Get up

On the beat now, uh

Come on now

Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile cheers
Uh

(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Yeah, I feel like going on, I feel like going on
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Come on, come on, erotic images float through me
You midnight rambler, baby
Uh

(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
Woo-hoo, dig it, for you anywhere
I don't know, I don't care
(Wish me love, a wishing well to kiss and tell)
But all I know is
Gotta, gotta be a midnight rambler, baby
UhTime, time, time
See what's become of me...

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around
For my possibilities
I was so hard to please

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a Hazy Shade of Winter

Hear the Salvation Army Band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry a cup in your hand

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a Hazy Shade of Winter

Hang onto your hopes my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again

Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with their scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky
Is a Hazy Shade of Winter

Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the groundAruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all

Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo

We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

To Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity

Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo

We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo

Port-au-Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?

Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to KokomoTonight, it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

Hear me crying out to you
You said, "never, never would I leave"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart, I'll pretend
That you are here again

Hear me crying out to you
You said, "never, never would I leave"
Here's a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

Give me one more chance to
Make it realThe flowers you gave me
Are just about to die
When I think about what could've been
Makes me want to cry

The sweet words you whispered
Didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

The memories of our loving
Still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere

Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still, what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all, at all

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can't hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
You can't hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

No, no-oh
How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely nightYeah

Lover, I'm on the street
Gonna go where the bright lights and the big city meet
With a red guitar on fire
Desire

She's a candle burning in my room
Yeah, I'm like the needle, needle and spoon
Over the counter with that shotgun
Pretty soon everybody got one
And the fever when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire, right

And the fever getting higher
Desire
Desire
Burning, burning

She's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise
In the year of election
Oh sister, I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealing hearts at a traveling show

For love or money money money, money money money
Money money money money money
And the fever, getting higher

Till things get out of control, oh

How do I know when it's love?
I can't tell you but it lasts forever, oh
How does it feel when it's love?
It's just something you feel together

Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson, uh

It's times like these I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again

I find I spend my time waiting on your call
How can I tell you, babe, my back's against the wall
I need you by my side to tell me it's all right
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore

Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love
'Cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me

Can't stop this feeling, I've been this way before
But with you I've found the key to open any door
I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms

Is this love (is this love?)Each day I live, I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one, but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown

I broke my heart, for every gain
To taste the sweet, I face the pain
I rise and fall, yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance, here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free

Oh, you're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time, moment in time

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free
Oh, I will feel, I will be freeI don't know why I like it
I just do
Ooh, ooh

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head, uh

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touch

Shocking whatI know it's been sometime
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day

We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me, ooh baby

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away

And what we had was so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know, oh

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there

And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?

And I know that you still care for me

For me

In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out
Of reach

The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again

We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby

Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got, listen baby
I bet everything on my wedding ring
I'm giving you the best that I got,
Givin' it to you babySometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue

'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world is closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I want to give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, see a ray of light
Oh, see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Oh yeah

Baby, there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
Hey

And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want your answer baby
It's all I'll ever need
It's all I'll ever need

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I want to give up
I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby
And everything's alright
Hey, everything's alright, so right

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain, yeah

When I see you smile, yeah, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything now
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby, when I see you smile
Smile at meIt must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh and I, I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away
You let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

So high I almost touch the sky

Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home

And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is a dream come true
A real life fantasy

Because there are no words that can explain
I'm living in ecstasy

And you can best believe I got your back
You never have to feel no pain
'Cause I dedicate my life to you
You'll never look for love again

No matter what your friends try to tell you

'Cause what I'm doing, I'm doing for you

Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Egotrips is not my thing

All these strange relationships
Really gets me down
I see nothing wrong
In spreading myself around, sing

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (tell me why)
I don't need (I don't need) permission, make my own decisions (my own decisions)
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)
It's my prerogative

I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)
I can live my life (It's my prerogative)
And I'm doing it just for you (It's my prerogative)
Tell me, tell me

Why can't I live my life (live my life)
Without all of the things that people say?

Yo, Teddy kick it like this
Oh, no, no
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

Everybody's talking (everybody's talking) all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
(Why don't they just let me live?)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (everybody's talking) 
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

What is this a blizzard
That I can't have money in pocket and people not talk about me?
This world is a trip, I don't know what's goin' on these days
Got this person over here talkin' 'bout me
Hey, listen this is my prerogative, I can do what I want to
I made this money, you didn't

You've gotta go for what ya know

There comes a time in our lives
You wanna be bigger
Gotta keep, keep on pushing,
You've gotta learn to take control, yeah

Now I've found out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it

Too hot to handle
Too cold to hold
They're called the Ghostbusters
And they're in control

Had 'em throwing a party
For a bunch of children
While all the while
The slime was under the building

So they packed up, regrouped
Got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed their proton packs
Off their backs and they split

Found out about Vigo
The master of evil
Try to battle my boys
That's not legal

(Oh-we-oh) They're in control

Rainy night and we worked all day
Both got jobs 'cause there's bills ta pay
We got somethin' they can't take away
Our love, our lives

Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothin' when I'm by your side
We got somethin' that'll never die
Our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh ta flesh, one to one (and it's all right)
And I'll never let go 'cause there's somethin' I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

Light a candle, blow the world away
Table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fancy, baby, that's OK
Our time, our way

So hold me close, better hang on tight
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride
Two kids hitchin' down the road'a life
Our world, our fight

If we stand side by side (all night)
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's all right)
And I'll know that you'll live in my heart 'til the day that I die

'Cause you were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

And my heart beats like a drum (all night)
Flesh ta flesh, one to one (and it's all right)
And I'll never let go 
'Cause somethin' I know deep insiiide

You were born to be my baby
Baby, I was made to be your man
We got somethin' to believe in
Even if we don't know where we stand
Only God would know the reasons
But I bet he must have had a plan
'Cause you were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made to be your man

You were born to be my baby
And baby, I was made
Ta be your manI guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love, it's suicide

You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
You left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I live and I die for you
I'll steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well, I can't promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And baby, you know my hands are dirty
(Well, woman you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'd be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I live and I die for you
I'll steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I wasn't there when you were happy
(I wasn't there to make you happy)
And I wasn't there when you were down, down
Didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out, oh

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I live and I die for you
I'll steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for

I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I wanna be the air for you
I'll be there for you

I live and I die for you
I'll steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-ohIf I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna let you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
You took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door, I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darlin', then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind, and darling

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

Ooh

If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
Ooh baby

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry

But if I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time (turn back time)
If I could find a way (find a way)
Then baby, maybe, maybe
You'd stay

Reach the stars
If I could reach the starsI get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can let go

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation is worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing what I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies
Oh it's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyesYa better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if ya don't wanna dance
You like four letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can

You got it
But are you gettin' it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun

You know ya, ya can't stop it
So don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you gettin' it?
Ooh really gettin' it?
Oh, come get it from me

(Gimme all of you lovin') Ev'ry little bit
(Gimme all that you got) Ev'ry bit of it
(Ev'ry bit of your lovin') Oh, c'mon an' live a bit
(Never wanna stop) Hey! But are you gettin' it?
(Armageddon it) Ooh, really gettin' it?
(Yes, Armaggedon it) C'mon, get it
Yeah!
Do do do
Uh oh

You try comin' on when you need some
But then you don't 'cause you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while your shakin' ya
And drive the pretty boys outta their heads

You got it
But are you gettin' it?
You flash your bedroom eyes like a jumpin' jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back

You know ya, ya can't stop it
So don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you gettin' it?
Ooh really gettin' it?
Oh, come get it from me

(Gimme all of you lovin') Ev'ry little bit
(Gimme all that you got) Ev'ry bit of it

(Armageddon it) Ooh, really gettin' it?
(Yes, Armaggedon it) C'mon, Steve, get it
Huh!

(Take it, take it, take it from me)
I got an itchy finger following me
(Pull it, pull it, c'mon trigger the gun)
'Cause the best is yet to come
I say
('Cause the best is yet to come)

Oh, are you gettin' it?
Oh, really gettin' it?
Yeah, are you gettin' it?
Ooh, really gettin' it?

(Oh, come get it from me)

(Gimme all that you got) Oh, are you getting it?
(Gimme all of your lovin') Oh, live a bit
(Gimme all that you got) Whoa

Live a bit
You've gotta live it
(Gimme all of your lovin') Oh, baby live it
(Gimme all that you got) C'mon and give it
(Ev'ry bit of your lovin') Oh, come on and give it
(Never want it to stop) Oh, are you gettin' it?

(Gimme all of your lovin') Ooh, really gettin' it?
(Gimme all that you got) Oh, are you gettin' it?
(Ev'ry bit of your lovin') Oh, live a bit
(Never want it to stop) WhoaSo you heard that I'm a rebel
With a heart made of stone
I got a restless spirit
That nobody can own

If a picture tells a story
Won't you listen to mine
I'm searching for the answer
But it's so hard to find

You'll see much deeper
When you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire
Burning in my eyes

Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love
I willing to fight

Love can be so heartless
When you turn out the lights
A mutual surrender
In the heat of the night

Life's an empty picture
When you're living alone
Maybe that's the reason
Every heart needs a home

Each time I fall down
I get on my feet again
I'm gonna win this battle
In the end

Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love

You'll see much deeper
When you read between the lines
Cause there's a fire
Burning in my eyes

Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love

Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, I'm a soldier of love
Shalalalalala, when the goin' gets rough
Shalalalalala, a soldier for your love

Like a thief in the night
Who can't get enough
I am willing to fight
'Cause I'm a soldier of love

Like a shot in the dark
When the goin' gets rough
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of loveThe one good thing in my life
Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her

The one good thing didn't stay too long (woo, who, who, who)
My back was turned and she was gone

Good thing, where have you gone
(Doo, doo, doobie doo)
My good thing, you've been gone too long
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo)

People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow, don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime

That's not what I want to hear (woo, who, who, who)
I want to hear she wants me near

Good thing, where have you gone
(Doo, doo, doobie doo)
My good thing, you've been gone too long
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room (woo, who, who, who)
Caught me dreaming like a fool

Good thing, ah, ah, ah, my good thing
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
My, my, my, my, good thing
Where have you gone
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
My good thing, mm, hmm, my good thing
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Girl, where have you gone
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)

It's been so long
Good God, girl
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Good God, girl
Good God, girl
(Good thing, doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Good God
(Doo, doo, doobie doo, good thing)
Good GodI can't stop
The way I feel
Things you do
Don't seem real

Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waitin' 'round's killin' me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get
Any rest
People say
I'm obsessed

Everything that's serious lasts
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I won't make it
On my own
No one likes
To be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myselfSometimes it's hard
To make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here

I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide

So open your eyes
And see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever

Baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me, I'll be around
Forever

We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time and I hope
That's the way it will stay

It's all up to you
To tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know

That I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now
Or ever and ever

Baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me, I'll be around
Forever, forever, yeah, yeah

Don't wanna lose you, lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
Don't wanna lose you now
Don't wanna lose you
Dont' wanna lose youWell the times are getting hard for you, little girl
I'm a humming and a strumming all over god's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Woman you're a mess going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark and you're gone

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

So shy, so shy, so shy, so shy
So shy, so shy, so shy, so shyTake me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home?)

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home?)

Just an urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags to riches or so they say
You gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' their time

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah yeah?

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who ya gonna believe

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah yeah

Girl, I think about you everyday now
Was a time when I wasn't sure but you, set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

Said woman, take it slow, it'll work itself out fine
All we need is, just a little patience
Said sugar, make it slow, and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience

Real loveI don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town

My head is full of magic, baby
And I can't share this with you
Feel I'm on a cross again, lately
But there's nothing to do with you

I'm alive, oh so alive
I'm alive, oh so alive

Your strut makes me crazy, makes me see you more clearly
Oh, baby, now I can see you
Wish I could stop, switch off the clock
Make it all happen for you

I'm alive, oh so alive
I'm alive, oh so alive

Don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town

My head is full of magic, baby
And I can share this with you
I feel I'm on top again, baby
That's got everything to do with you

I'm alive, oh so alive
I'm alive, oh so aliveCherish, cherish

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I'll take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance

You are my destiny 
I can't let go
Baby, can't you see?
Cupid please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
(I'm always singing it)

Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side 
(Oh baby I) cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
(I'm always singing it)

You got the power to make me feel good 
(And baby I) perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen-karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big, strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long-stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please!

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now
Better make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now
Better make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself!God?

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name, it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice, feels like flying
I close my eyes, oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes, Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

Like a child, you whisper softly to me
You're in control, just like a child, now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream, let the choir sing

When you call my name, it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

When you call my name, it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me thereStep by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way
What can I say?
It's true, I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay

When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes, takes the fall
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop, the next one's gonna be me

Only emptiness remains
It replaces all, all the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

We never win

Only emptiness remains
It replaces all, all the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiersHey kids, rock and roll
Rock on, ooh my soul
Hey kids, boogie too, did ya?

Hey shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes
Hey kids, rock and roll, rock on

And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Still looking for that blue jean, baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean

And where do we go from here?
Which is the way that's clear?

Hey kid, boogie tooEvery generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

Oh, crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defense

(Say it loud) Say it loud
(Say it clear) Say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) Oh, when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up and don't give in
You may just be okay

(Say it loud) Say it loud
(Say it clear) Say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) Oh, when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

(Say it loud) So say it, say it, say it loud
(Say it clear) Oh, say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) It's too late when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

(Say it loud) So say it, say it, say it loud
(Say it clear) Oh, say it clear
(Say it loud) Don't give up, don't give in
(Say it clear) Don't wait til it's too late(Okay Eddie, this one's for you.)

Blame it on the rain (rain, rain)I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But you still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me 'round your itty-bitty finger
With your magic smile

You kept me hangin' on a lover's cross a while
You put your spell on me
Took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl
I'm gonna miss you, baby

Giving all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wasting my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me
To see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl I'm gonna miss you

Like a honey bee
You took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale
You are so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal

When you had a taste of paradise
Back on Earth can feel as cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you

Giving all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wasting my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me
To see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl I'm gonna miss you

The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me

(Girl)
I really mean that much to you?

(Man)
Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
You're soft, succulent, so sweet and thin
That's kind of like a vision upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's, oh, so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality, you that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice would ring in my ears
It stimulate my senses, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotion, love-making enjoyin'
That's for me to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, or as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl, I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love youWho's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Gigolo, huh, sukka?
Gigolo, gigolo, huh, sukka?

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me

No money man could win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Get funky
Yeah Timmy
Tell it like it is
Check out this DJ

So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shows worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me

Smokin'. Not cokin'. Get funky sax.
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch.
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance.
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass... rock this place!
What is he like?
What's he like anyway?
Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man
You know I mean?

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Wind on my face, sound in my ears
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind
As I sink, diving down deep... deeper into your soul.

No moneyman can win my love
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of.
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance
We do the dive every time we dance

Look into his eyes
Oh, oh, he's been telling lies
He's a lover boy at play (girl)
He don't play by rules (oh, ho)
Oh, oh, girl, don't play the fool now

You're the one giving up the love
Any time he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
And running with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
When he's out

He's a cold-hearted snake (girl)
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh, he's been telling lies
He's a lover boy at play (girl)
He don't play by rules (oh, ho)
Oh, oh, girl, don't play the fool now

It was only late last night
He was out there sneaking
Then he called you up to check
That you were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick-or-treating
When it comes to true love, girl
With him there's no one home

He's a cold-hearted snake (girl)
Look into his eyes
Oh, oh, he's been telling lies
He's a lover boy at play (girl)
He don't play by rules (oh, ho)
Oh, oh, girl, don't play the fool now

You could find somebody better, girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better, girl
He's c-cold as ice

(Cold as ice)
(He's cold as ice)
(He's cold as ice)

Stay away from him, girl

Baby, pick your head up
Come on and look me in the face
'Cause I can tell that somethin'
Is bringin' you down (Why are you down?)

Is it the rumor that another boy
Wants to take your place?
(I hear he's after your heart)
Have you been hearin' the stories?
They're goin' around

Even if he promised me the world

Just remember I'm forever your girl

Honey, listen to me
Your love is all I need
You should know that I don't need nothin'
That money can buy
(Just promise that you'll never leave me)

So if a boy were to come along
And try to make me leave you
(Girl, I'd go out of my mind)
There'd be no need to worry
I'm tellin' you why
(I need to hear that you really love me)

Baby, don't you know that I love you
And I'd never put nobody above you
He could promise the moon and the stars above
Even if he promised me the world

When the mountains crumble into the sea (ah ha ha)
That's the day when someone will come between you and me

Baby, just remember I gave you my heart
(Tell me) Ain't no one gonna tear us apart

Even if he promised me pearls
Honey, you know I ain't lyin'

How about some information please?

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh)
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh)
Or are you just having fun?

Time's standin' still
Waiting for some (waitin' for some) small clue
(Let me tell you now)
I keep getting chills
When I think your love (when I think your love) is true

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
How about some information please?

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh)
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh)
Or are you just having fun?

You are so hard to read
You play hide and seek
With your true intentions

If you're only playing games
I'll just have to say
A- b-b-bye bye, b-b-b-b-bye

Do do you love me? (Do do you love me baby?)
Do do you love me? (Do do you love me, hey baby?)
Do do you love me? (Do do you love me, hey baby?) Come on, now!
Do do you love me? (Do do you love me baby?)

Do you really want to love me foreverWell, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
'Cos it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

'Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

She knows (she knows)
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows
Yeah, she knows (she knows)
No matter how far apart we are
She knows, I'm always right there beside her

We're two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever, til the end of time
Two hearts two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together til the end of timeWe both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried, but I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song, playin' on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow

I guess every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

I guess every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn"Oh, I got a live one here! Ha, ha, ha..."

Tumble inside my head
The way that we used to be
Things that we said
No one has ever made me believe so strong
You left me to wonder
How did our love go wrong

Angelia
Where you running to now
Angelia
Got to make you turn around

I lie awake at night
Wait for the sun to shine
I still feel you next to me
Your lips on mine
Without a warning
You made our love a lie
You said you were sorry
But you never told me why

Angelia
Where you running to now
Angelia
Got to make you turn around

Maybe my love is in vain
Maybe you're the hurting kind
Can't take no more of this pain
I've got to get you off my mind

Tried to be what you wanted
I gave you all I had
You left me with nothin'
Nothin' but a photograph

Angelia
Where you running to now
Angelia
Got to make you turn around
Angelia
Where you running to now
Angelia
Got to make you turn aroundOceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive this romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me goin' crazy

Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you, waiting for youYeah, yeah
Whoa

We work our bodies weary
To stay alive
There must be more to living
Than nine to five

Why should we wait for some better time?
There may not even be a tomorrow
Ain't no sense in losing your mind
I'm gonna make it worth the ride

Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?

Ignore the hesitation
That ties your hands
Use your imagination
And take a chance

Won't let my moment of truth pass me by
I've gotta make my move, now or never
And if they turn me loose on this town
They're gonna have to hold me down

Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?
Yeah

Don't you know
Ain't gonna stop up until we're satisfied?
Don't you know
We shouldn't stop until we're satisfied?
Yeh, yeah

Don't you know
Ain't gonna stop until I'm satisfied? Yeah
Don't you know
We won't give up until we're satisfied?
Oh, oh, oh

Why should I stop before I'm satisfied? OwI don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control,
But one look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution, I know it
You gotta stay away from me
Stay away from me

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes
And suddenly my heart can't tell you no
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe its true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
Living hell...I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns to dark

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been)
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before...

Oh, listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart, before
You tell him goodbye

(Listen to your heart)
(Listen to your heart) Oh, take a listen to it, oh
(Listen to your heart) Take a, take a listen
(Listen to your heart) Ooh yeah
(Listen to your heart)
(Listen to your heart) Oh, oh
(Listen to your heart) Oh, ooh
(Listen to your heart) Oh, oh
(Listen to your heart) Oh
(Listen to your heart) Oh, oh
(Listen to your heart)

You will never never never know me (No you won't) (x3)Ricky was a young boy
He had a heart of stone
Lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely out of school
Came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, oh no

He had no money
No, no good at home
Walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go
Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's eighteen and life to go, yeah

Tequila in his heartbeat
His veins burned gasoline
It kept his motor running
But it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure
"Ricky's the wild one"
He married trouble
Had a courtship with a gun

Bang-bang, shoot 'em up
The party never ends
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
And now it's

Eighteen and life, you got it

And I need someone I can call my own
To fall in love, that's what everyone's dreaming of

Life is too short, to live alone
Without someone to call my own
I will care for you, you will care for me
Our love, will live forever

Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love that I long for
Shower me with your love
Shower me with the love I've been waiting for

I close my eyes and pray all my wishes come true
Every night I go to sleep
Until you're mine I'll wait for you endlessly

Like the stars that shine way up in the sky
Our love will live forever

You make the most of a ify situation.
I'm weighing my decision
Who's to say if it's love, or if it isn't?
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you.
Don't mean to lead you on,
But I want to take it slowly, slowly.

Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before, ah.
Don't rush me.
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for
Desire can mean danger,
I wanna lover, not another stranger
I'm saving all my passion,
Who's to say if its love, or just attraction?
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you.
Don't mean to lead you on, But I want to take it slowly, slowly.

And my resistance is weakening, weakening every time we touch.
Baby, you get everything, everything that I've been dreamin' of.

Don't rush me.
I've made that mistake before, oh yeah.
Don't rush me. This love could be so much more,
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah.
My resistance is weakening
Every time we touch,
Cause baby you've got everything,
Everything That I've been dreaming of.

Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before,
Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more,
It's well worth the waiting for.
Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before,
Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more,
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah.High time we made a stand
And shook up the views of the common man
And the love train rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most

Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracy?
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days, they're gonna call it the blues, yeah yeah

What you're doin' with a clown like me
Is surely one of life's little mysteries

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
"How did I ever win your love?"
What did I do
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

Well, I'm the guy who never learned to dance
Never even got one second glance
Across a crowded room was close enough
I could look but I could never touch

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
"How did I ever win your love?"
What did I do
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

Don't anyone wake me
If it's just a dream
'Cause she's the best thing
Ever happened to me

All you fellows
You can look all you like
But this girl you see
She's leavin' here with me tonight

There's just one more thing that I need to know
If this is love why does it scare me so?
It must be somethin' only you can see
'Cause girl I feel it when you look at me

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
"How did I ever win your love?"
What did I do
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, awwwButton your lip, baby

Wipe out the past

With mixed emotions
And you're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean

This coming and going
Is driving me nuts
This to-ing and fro-ing
Is hurting my guts

So get off the fence, now
It's creasing your butt
Life is a party
Let's get out and strut, yes

You're not the only one
With mixed emotions

The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me
My threds are fresh and I'm looking def
Yo, what's up with L-O-C?
The girls I sawjokin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no-name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, "Why you so fly?"
He said, "Funky Cold Medina"

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass
And the girls will come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog, when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the Wild Thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me
Before he was much, much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house
For the Funky cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'? I got every dog in my neighborhood
Breakin' down my door, I got Spuds McKenzie, Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, "Hi, my name is Sheena"
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky cold Medina
She said, "I'd like a drink, " I said OK, I'd go get it
Then a couple of sips, she sold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess
Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around
With in Oscar Meyer weiner
You must be sure that your girl is pure
For the Funky Cold Medina
You know, ain't no playin' with a man
This is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?

Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on the Love Connection
The audience voted and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' about plans for a weddin'
Said wait, slow down, love, not so fast, says "I'll be seein' ya"
That's why I found you don't play around
With the Funky Cold Medina
Ya know what I'm sayin', that Medina's a monster, y'all
Funky Cold MedinaLet's do it

Workin all week
Nine to five for my money
So, when the weekend comes
I go get live with the honey
Rollin down the street
I saw this girl and she was pumpin
I winked my eye, she got into the ride
Went to a club, we're jumpin
Introduced myself as Loc
She said, "You're a liar" 
I said, "I got it goin on baby doll,
and I'm on fire"
Took her to the hotel
She said, "You're the king"
I said, "Be my queen, if you know what I mean,
and let us do the wild thing"

Wild thing
Wild thing

Shoppin at the mall
Lookin for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she cool rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said,
"You have plans for the night?"
I said, "Hopefully if things go well
I'll be with you tonight"
So, we journeyed to her house
One thing led to another
I keyed the door, I cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say
I was hanging by a string
She said, "Hey you two, I was once like you
and I liked to do the wild thing"

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect
Hangin out is always hype 
And when me and the crew leave a shindig
I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame
I ain't lyin fellas, she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine
It's still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
And I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock
She was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin
From doin the wild thing

Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing

Doin a little show
At the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock
So, I said, "what the heck?"
She wanted to come on stage
And do her little dance
So, I said chill for now
But maybe later you'll get your chance
So, when the show was finished
I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go
Without a word to say 
We was all alone and she said, 
"Tone let me tell you one thing 
I need fifty dollars to make you holler
I get paid to do the wild thing"

Say what?
Yo, love you must be kiddin
You're walkin, babe
Just break outta here 
Hasta la vista, baby

Wild thingGot a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray
But man, they're really coming back

I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your light
There's a color deep inside them
Like blue suburban sky
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe

I don't need to be a superman
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way, yeah

Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back
And makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you, oh oh

(Heaven isn't too far away)
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends say
I know we're gonna find a way

(Heaven)
Whoa, oh
(Heaven)
Whoa, oh
(Heaven)
It's not too far away, oh oh
Whoa, oh
YeahLittle child
Dry your crying eyes
How can I explain
The fear you feel inside
'Cause you were born
Into this evil world
Where man is killing man
And no one knows just why

What have we become?
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

Little child
You must show the way
To a better day
For all the young
'Cause you were born
For the world to see
That we all can live
With love and peace

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins

What have we become?
Just look what we have done
All that we destroyed
You must build again

No more presidents
And all the wars will end
One united world
Under God

When the children cry
Let them know we tried
'Cause when the children fight
Let them know it ain't right

When the children pray
Let them know the way
'Cause when the children sing
Then the new world begins
