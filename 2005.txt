Temperature risin', okay let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle

I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nypmho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into

Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing 'round like a low rider

Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this

Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone

I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind

As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man it's on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle it's on
And we gon' sip till every bubble in the bottle is gone

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through 
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl 
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run 
And I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out baby)

Mr. LonelyI've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing

Everytime I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
All my dreams are in your eyes

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch, when we love
The stars line up, the wrong becomes undone
Naturally my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way
I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
When mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin' you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
When the storm blows your way

I wanna be earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind

I wanna be inside your heaven

(Bow Wow)

Now I done been with different kind of girls

So like I done seen them all

And I done seen the best of the best

Baby, still I ain't impressed cause

Ain't none of them at all (like you)

If you know how I feel when I chill

Look, if I'm seen with a girl

Then she gotta be just (like you)

And baby that's the way I feel

And I ain't got no choice

But for me to keep it real

'Cause when we first got together

Starting hanging out you was skeptical at first

Had to figure out if

I was the kind of guy that

Would try to dog you out but

I ain't that kind of guy you try to make me out

You found out when you turned to my baby

I showed them other brothers

How to treat a lady

I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes

And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady

Cause baby you know





(Ciara)

And every time I think about you I smile

When you ride, when you call, when you come around

Your love is amazing to me

I can't wait till I see you (I wanna be with you again)

And every time your out on the road (I'll make a trip)

And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)

That I'm your main chick

Who got that game chick

One in the same chick

The one you can hang with





(Bow Wow)

Ok we hit the mall, pop tags

Spend a few G's (Cheesin')

Hit the runway to a new season

It ain't nothing

Spoil the one I care for

Feel like I ain't doin' enough

That's when I shape off

I give you this, give you that

What chu need love

You know I got it

Holla at me if you need love

In affection 'cause I'll be your protection

Kind of hard job but I'll do till perfection

And you can tell that I ain't tryin' to let you go

I get with you when I can

So that's how I let you know

And you be trippin' cause sometimes I gotta go

But chu the first one

I hollared to right after my show

Hey now I was trippin' in a sense

I was tense but my body's lose around you

But I'ma do without you

I gotta get it together, say whateva

Since I met you my life seems so betterI've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around

Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feelin' lonely
Just thinkin' about you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin turnin' in my bed
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' about your beauty it makes me
Weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my heart
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin')
What am I doin' wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart

Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm tryin' to make this right
I don't know what to do
I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it with you then we'll maybe
We could ride together
We could do this all night
Now I don't care if you've got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' about your beauty it makes me
Weak...

Wear my candy you're my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up wait a minute
Baby you so damn independent
Lovin' everything you're representing
Got alot of money and I love to spend it
And that's what's up
And I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy
Cause momma know how I do
We gone rendezvous

Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart
** Amor **I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone and I walk-a

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk-a

My shadow's only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk aloneUh huh, this my shit

Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say

That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get 
What I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it, you put me on

This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning 
I don't know where to go from here

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

What day is it? And in what month?

Sometime wanna be your lover sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug hold hands slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable

Be a good girl now turn around and get these whipping

Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Boy I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake it off

By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say I told you so

Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

I gotta, shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Boy I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake it off

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off... (I'm gonna shake it off)

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off... ooh
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it
Off...

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was

Hold up my phone's breakin' up
Imma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind

'Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't ya know

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

I gotta shake it off

Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce
Shake it off
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounceOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sittin' here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything, I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling, now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here 'cause, baby
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio, singing to me
"If you think you're lonely now."
Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station 
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back, baby, please 
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong togetherBaby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt

You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are you stick around
And I just don't know why

If I was yo man, baby you
Never worry 'bout, what I do
I'll be coming home, back to you

Make me your selection 
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you

Your true beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts 
You're a dime plus ninety-nine
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth 

Everywhere you go they stop and stare 
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control baby you know 

If I was yo man (baby you)

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out My Melody"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

The Game:
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

50 Cent
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

The Game:
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know "What's Going On" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma

50 Cent
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

(Verse I - Game)
Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
Chrome hyrdolics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga betta, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton, unh
Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin rocks when Master P was sayin' "Unnnh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum
Got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, unh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt

(Verse II - 50 Cent)
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-ca-lade
Low pro so look like I'm riding on blades
In one year mang, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good
'Cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

(Verse III - Game)
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm riding on bulbs
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York riding on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)

(Verse IV - Game and 50 Cent)
(50 Cent)
50, unh
Bentley, unh
Em came 'n' gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun
Fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n' ya done
Homie, it's Game time
(Game)
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months
But Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggaz like, "huh?"

Thinkin' I'm a punk
Get your fuckin' head, lumped

Ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedda

Prowl for the best chick, yes I'm on the lookout

Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it

Think I wanna make that move, now (Gonna make a move now)
Baby, tell me how you like it, it's me and you (Me and you)

Now, I've been waiting (It's just me and you)
Think I wanna make that move, now (It's just us two)
Baby, tell me if you like (Baby, it's me and you now)
It's me and you, now (Now), I've been waiting
Think I wanna make that move, now (Gonna make a move now)
Baby, tell me how you like it, it's me and you (Me and you)They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Ride with a new chick, she like “hold up”
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma

Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' to bone ain't tryin' to have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas try to jack for some
But we packin' somethin' that we have for 'em
Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum

Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin' like “Hit this dough”
Police pull up right behind and is in his throat

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, “Who is that producin'?”
This the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud ,I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

I been drinkin' and smokin'
Holdin' shit cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope
This big ol' Excursion swervin' all up in the curve

A nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again, it's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And rollin' another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck

I got a blunt up my right hand
40 oz. in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs

Yo, I gotta get back to backstreets
Wonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock-Glock, shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key

With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like “fuck 'em all”
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
But well if you want, nigga, you poppin' dark
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

Now do what you think it so, I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slower
And they upset for sho cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro

So they get behind me tryin' to check my tags
Look at my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, well keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'

Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood

I'ma laugh at you, and then I'm a have to cruise
Yeah, my number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This a message to the laws, tellin' them “We hate you”

I can't be touched or tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone tryin' to find a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty

That laffy taffyWhere is the moment when we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Shittin' all over the world
Fuck you bitchesWhere'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back homeI remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mmm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice, mmm

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them

Mmm, ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
ProbablyHoney, why you calling me so late?
It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything okay?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And yes, I dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me?
Will it start a fight?
No, I don't think he has a clue

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye

But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
(And I never wanna say goodbye)
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel

Honey, why you calling me so late?My life is brilliant

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure

She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel
With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with youCome with me
Stay the night
Just say the words but boy it don't feel right
What do ya expect me to say (You know it's just too little too late)
You take my hand and you say you've changed
But boy you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you it's just a game (You know it's just too little too late)

So let me on down now

Aqui con el seái? LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy... ya tu sabes
Uno, dos, tres, muevete

Y'all know what this is... So... So... Def

The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggle
She said

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself

It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're waddling like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I bet this girl will stop it
But she continued to pop it

You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the afterparty is at my body
Meet me you're invited

She said

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself

It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you (make me hurt you)

She said

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself (Oh)
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)

It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself

It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind

I got my hoe on my right side, pouring some cups
My whole hood is on to left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today

But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jets
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet, 'cause you can

And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends

As you want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to
Hey, hey, Luda, I am on top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame

And I just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves
And let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius

Get up and I stay harder then a cinderblock man
Hey i'm just a bedroom gangster

The original breadwinner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like "Oh my God, she can-"

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
Don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go

Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price

Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But I turn around and I let it ride

Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart
And I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to

What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do it like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time

People swore it off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)

It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)
See baby we been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)

Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)

I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

See this is real talk
I'm always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day, every day)

Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you (no, this ain't for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)

Fellas tell your lady she's the one (fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We've been...

Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home ('cause I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with youI am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined

I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries 
Are outside the lines
We've been conditioned 
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, oh

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken

Do do do do do do do-do
Oh yeah

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone

And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months and for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah

(Enough is enough)
No more walkin' 'round with my head down
I'm so over being blue 
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio? Oh

(Leave me alone) Leave me alone 
(Stupid love songs) Oh
Hey, don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

Said I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

And I'm so sick of love songs 
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio?Nelly: Am I throwing you off?
Timbaland: Nope
Nelly: Didn't think so

Timbaland: How you doin' young lady?
That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
Will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kind of cute

Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'mma lay mine's down

But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health

I want you on my team
So does everybody else

Shh, baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know

If you with it girl, I know a place we can go

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

(Bring that on?) You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are

I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin' on aluminum foil
Smilin', showin' off my diamonds sippin on some potin oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real

My motivation is from thirty pointers V VS the furniture
My mouthpiece simply symbolize success
I got da wrist wear and neck wear that's captivatin'
But it's my smile that's got these on-lookers spectatin'

My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carats than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grillz

Had a whole top diamond and da bottom row's goldLook at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
It's time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes meLala lala lala lala, oh

Lala lala lala lala, oh
Just feels like somethin' real

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question and you're, of course, the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

Yung Joc
Niggas in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like
Joc where ya stay?
Tell 'em College Park
Where they chop cars
Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, jays on my feet
I'm on that Patron so get like me
'69 cutlass wit the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto'
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do (OK)

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Verse numba 2, do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew we ceritifed stars
Ready in the front bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls like girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Time to set it off, let these niggas know
Have ya every seen a chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail, but they thank I don't know
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask 'em how I know, it's me, surprise!
Put it in the air, rep where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga I ain't scared to share it

There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', so we're breakin' free
You know the world can see us
In a way that different than who we are
Creating space between us, till we're separate hearts
But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe

We're breakin' free

There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach
If we're tryin', yeah, we're breakin' free
Oh, we're breakin' free! Ooh

Connected by a feelin', ooh, in our very souls
Rising till it lifts us up, so everyone can see

Not a want, but a need
Both of us, breaking free

Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it

Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop

Make it rain for her so she don't stop

In her fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin' her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down
You know I like when you hike and you throw it all around
Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

See you lookin' at me now what it's gon' be

If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know

Snoop Dog
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'

Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (baby I see you), mmm

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Akon
Girl, and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary

Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass

Akon, Slim Shady

Could she be that lady

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Up front style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed down
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now

(I feel it) Go on and crack now
(Oh, I see it) Don't let back now
(I'm-a call her) Then I put the mack down
(Money? No problem) Pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo
And possibly bend you over

Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, till you get sore
Smack that, oh oh oh

Eminem
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when I throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they goin' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Pretty Cat Dolls
Try'na hold my woody back through my drawers

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're
I'm like, I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place

Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal, every gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

Akon

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo

Especially towards you
Puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin'

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
His one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
His one and only
This beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
Have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it
Ha ha
It's not worth our time
Oh
We can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then till I saw you with him again)
I walked in
On your love scene
Slow dancing
(You stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
Have to let go
The innocence is gone

Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple-
He's the one to blame

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (don't touch)

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
Got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

(Irreplaceable, irreplaceable)
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you? (nothing, no nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you... (I won't shed a tear...)
I won't lose a wink of sleep, 'cause the truth of the matter is 
Replacing you is so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left, mmm
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin', baby, hey hey

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
'Cause I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me, nigga, pack all yo' bags, we finished
You must not know 'bout me, 'cause you made your bed, now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceableIt's Britney, bitch
I see you, and I just wanna dance with you

Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you (You, you)
Public display of affection (Ooh)
Feels like no one else in the room (But you)

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking (Keep on rocking)
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing

You got my permission now

We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (Keep on rocking)

Bet you didn't see this one coming
The incredible Lago (Mo- mo- mo- mo- mo-)
The legendary Miss Britney Spears, ha ha
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
'Cause I ain't going nowhere, (Mo- mo- mo- mo- mo-), ha ha
(More)Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...

And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go
I always know
'Cause you make me smile
Even just for a whileI'm staring out into the night, trying to hide the pain
I'm goin' to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

Well I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, well I'm going home

The miles are getting longer it seems, the closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true and I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try

So I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all and then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, yeah

Oh, I'm going home, back to the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from, no I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
I said these places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home, I'm going homeI was blown away, what could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that

I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
Because a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one 
It's not over

I've taken all I could take and I cannot wait
We're wastin' too much time
Bein' strong, holdin' on
Can't let it bring us down

My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
Because a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one 
It's not over

We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
Because a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one 
It's not over

Let's start over
It's not over, yeah, yeah
This love is killin' me, but you're the only one
It's not overForgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

I'm through with doubt
There's nothing left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep paying

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should

I know you said
"Can't you just get over it?"
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it

I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter
Sayin' that I better 
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should

Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waitingI am an arms dealer 
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words 
And I don't really care which side wins 
As long as the room keeps singing 
That's just the business I'm in     

This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race

I wrote the gospel on giving up 
(You look pretty sinking) 
But the real bombshells have already sunk  
(Prima donnas of the gutter) 
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep 
Crashing not like hips or cars
No, more like p-p-p-parties 

This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race

All the boys who the dance floor didn't love 
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough 
Sing until your lungs give out 

This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Now you) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Wear out the groove) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Sing out loud) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 
(Oh, oh) 
This ain't a scene; it's a goddamn arms race 

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh, so intricate

Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane and I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines
Shopping for expensive thangs

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days
When I had a Mustang and now I'm

First class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life

I'm talkin' champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothin' but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us

First I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones, takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

I got problems up to here, I've got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things that I don't want to know (fuck y'all)
I've got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that be really cool
Damn It's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home)
He let his daughter know

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way

'Cause I've

It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (Escape)

And I could be your favorite girl, forever
Perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground

So baby
Times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me

I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me

Touching you like it's our first time

Take you into my senses
Wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, It's round two
Matter of fact it's closer to three
She like, "how long I been 'sleep?"
Shorty, kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me
My angel this is wonderful
Thanks, for letting me bless ya
Come down, fly, right, drift back into heaven
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

And you can't see my eyes unless my head is bent, you dig?

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Ya boy gettin' paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (Choose one)
Stay sky high (Twisted), Fly wit the stars (Twinkle, Twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missing (Flossin')
I'm sitting clean with the bottom kitted (do it)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistening (Ballin'!)
But I spent bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doing the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screaming "fuck the cops"

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (One chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (Speeding)
100 g's worth of ice on the audermar? (Flossy)
And we in the street life until they call the law (Ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet (Got em)
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 a.m.: we was at the club (What happened?)
2 a.m.: 10 bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And about 3-something I was thinking about grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Nigga, could you buy that?
I keep 20 in the pocket (Light Change)
Talk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)
But of course gotta fly ...? (Where?)
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get Your Money Up)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got an urge (Speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous living in the fast lane (Ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'mma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (Let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Ya dig, another day another dollar
Fast life fuckerAin't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love

(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

[Rap by T.I.:]
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly

Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My loveHey girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand

So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry

It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah

Now girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)

Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it, no
Don't want to talk about it, hmm
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way

Just so confused about it, uh
Feeling the blues about it, yeah
I just can't do without you
Can you tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry

Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah

Yo, yo
Let me paint this picture for you baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you find out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey

You should listen to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now little Lisa is only 9 years old
She's tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all all alone and they never met her family
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listenin'
Mama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

Little Nicole is only 10 years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
There's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but some get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops x to get rid of all the pain
'Cause she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection hes usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's 'bout to run away and never come back.

Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid

I want to dive into you
Forget what we're going through
I get behind, you make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no) So this is goodbye

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

'Cause I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry

You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why

This is why I'm hot, I don't gotta rap
I can sell a mil' sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say we lost it, so I'mma bring it back

I love the dirty dirty, 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit I watch 'em get it on the floor

And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it any day
Compton to Hollywood as soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low-low, I do it the Cali way

And when I hit the Chi', people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my, my attire
They love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why

You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another person, another drop
16 bars, 24 a pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got

I'm into drivin' cars, push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what you need, you know I get 'em by the flock

I call my homie Black, meet me on the ave
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spinners, see my pimpin' never dragged
Find me wit' different women that you niggas never had

For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean, the way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot my nigga this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh

This is why I'm hot

You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot

This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say, "Yeah, I paid a guap."
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop

They hop in the car, I tell them, "All aboard!"
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em, man, they tell me that's they song

They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck and compliments the arm 
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare

Then niggas start to hate, tearrange their face
But little do they know I keep them things by waist-side
I reply: Nobody gotta die
Similar to Li'l Weezy 'cause I got that fire

This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot, uh

This is why I'm hot

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly)
You ain't 'cause you not 
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hotWant to but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
Hust kinda stuck between my fantasy and what is real

I need it when I want it
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I stop every day
Knowing that I won't

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even If I did I don't know If I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move
But I like it

And it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
All because of you
And it's all because of you

All because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gon get me some
Know I should stay away from
'Cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave

I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even If I did I don't know If I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby you have become my addiction
I am so strung out on you
I can barely move
But I like it

All because of you

Ain't no doubt
So strung out

So strung out
Over you
Over you

Because of you
And it's all because of you
Never get enough

Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug

She's the sweetest drugIn the day, in the night
Say it right, say it all
You either got it or you don't
You either stand or you fall

When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh, you could mean everything to me

I can't say (say) that I'm not (not)
At a loss (loss) and at fault (fault)

I could show (show you) you tonight, you tonight

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh, you could mean everything to me

From my hands, I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you
Another brick that I laid

From my body (from my body) I could show you (I could show you)
A place (a place) God knows (that only God knows)
You should know, this space is holy (oh)
Do you really wanna go? (two, three, four)Uh-huh uh-huh (Shia, Rihanna)

Uh-huh uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh uh-huh (Ho)
No clouds in my storms
Let it rain
I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down like the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fellas
We fly higher than weather
And she flies it better
You know me
In anticipation
For precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay
Rain man is back
With little Miss Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella

Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh
Under my umbrella
Ella ella, eh eh eh eh, eh eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because…

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end

Now that it's rainin' more than ever

They say we too young to get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care, we made it very clear
And they also said that we couldn't last together

Oh, I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be that she wasn't the girl for me

You're dating other guys, you're telling me lies
Oh, I can't believe what I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind and I don't think it's clever

We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, (woah oh, woah oh, woah oh,) ooh ooh (woah)Step one: you say, "We need to talk"
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a lifeIs it going? Is it going? Is it going? Is it going?
I don't know
What you're lookin' for
Oh yeah, boss
Come on

I'm the type of girl that look you dead in the eye-eye

Now, I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV, "Just let me clear the air..."
We missed you on the charts last week, damn, that's right, you wasn't there

Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for youIf I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boyThere's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the back seat, gotta be first (Aha)

I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring, just like a circus (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip, just like a circus (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
Don't stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor, just like a circus (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)

There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware

I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring, just like a circus (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip, just like a circus (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)

Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor, just like a circus (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)

Let's go

Oh yeaheaheahI used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldOoh oh
Ooh oh

I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside
It was a rush
What a rush (what a rush)

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me
It's just too much
Just too much (just too much)

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You've got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think
When you're all alone
All that we could be
Where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath
When I look at you?
Are you holding back
Like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away
Going away

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hangin', spendin' time
Girl, are we just friends?
Is there more?
Is there more?

See, it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe
That we can make this into
Something that will last
Last forever
Forever

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we could be, where this thing could go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away
Going away

Why do I keep running from the truth? (why do I keep running)
All I ever think about is you (all I ever think about)
You've got my hypnotized (hypnotized), so mesmerized (mesmerized)
And I just got to know

Do you ever think (ever think) when you're all alone (all alone)
All that we could be, where this thing could go? (go)
Am I crazy or falling in love? (crazy)
Is it real or just another crush? (another crush, yeah, yeah)

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back, like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying, trying to walk away (whoa)
But I know this crush ain't goin' away (this crush ain't)
Goin' away
Goin' away
Goin' awayI've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed was there all along
Within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life... my life

More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
This is the time of my life
The time of my life
The time of my lifeCan't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh baby)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh baby)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh baby)
Can't help it

First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me
Play it cool but I knew you knew
That Cupid hit me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh baby)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh no)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh how)
Can't help it

Can't breathe when you touch me, see
Butterflies so crazy
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
So in love with you

She can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh no)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh please)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh no)
Can't help it

You know this ain't the first time
This has happened to me, this love sick thing
I like serious relationships
And a girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up
And bites me and I'm back

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(In love)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
(Oh God)
Can't help it, the girl can't help it

Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I ain't dealing rubber bands

That's what I told her
Her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier
She ready for rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover

The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack

Let me show it, made me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them rosé bottles foaming

She wouldn't stop, made it drop

Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cuz my knot's so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas know you thorough and the girls say yes (Yes)
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of Hard Knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue yankee is my graduation cap (It's Hova)
Dipping different rovers, whippin' with the soda (Hova)
Could you even have any doubt after Doubt it was over?

No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us

Lil Wayne
No one on the corner has swagger like moi, 
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream, "Papi, no más"
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
And when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal
And my jewels, blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha, what the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us 'cause we the only thing you talk about

No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (And I'm done)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Bye)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah)
No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ha, you think?)
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (That's right)

T.I.
Ay, you go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kan-yeezy for diversity and me for controversy
On my verses, picture perfect; on that spittin,' serve a purpose
Ye ain't livin' what you kickin,' then you worthless
Looking from the surface, it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off 
Blast off and have outstanding qualities
Sell a lot of records, I respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ok)
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah, that's right)
No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ok)
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah, so you noticed, huh?)
No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ha, yeah)
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Ok, tell 'em for me, shawty)
No one on the corner have swagger like us (Yeah, that's right)
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah)

No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us

Like us, like us, like us, like us, like us...I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Come on, girl

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Staring me down
I know you feel it too

I'm slipping into the lava
And I'ma trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby

Said we're burnin' up in this place tonight
The brothers singing loud (and we're feeling right)
Get up and dance (don't try and fight it)
Big Rob is for real (and that's no lie)
Stop, drop and roll (and touch the floor)
It keeps on burnin' up (more and more)
I got JB with me laying it down
Come on boys, bring the chorus around

I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeah)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (yeah, come on, Nick)
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, baby
Burnin' up, burnin' up
For you, babyI'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, till it's over, love
Till we lose control, system overload
Screamin' no, no, no, no, no

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin' to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fo' it finally got through?
You lose, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose

I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
No, I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' gone
Keep it on a roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose

I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I been down this road, too many times before
I'm not lovin' you, way I wanted to

So keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Keepin' your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, your love locked down
Now keep your love locked down, you lose, you lose
You lose
You lose
You loseAkon:

Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked itKevin Rudolf
I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock
Let it rock
Let it rock

Lil Wayne
Yeah
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda
And Tamara
Ménagez-moi
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up

Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Baby like socks that's on the ground

My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, Like the remainder

Kevin Rudolf
I wish I could be
As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No not this timeClosed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
Ooh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Oh, you cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love

Don't treat me to these things of the world
(I'm not that kind of girl)
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jackpot

Just make sure they that special somebody
Young money

You know who you are...

Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok! Let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup, the lady give her eighty some paper cut

Now picture us, it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention, "It's true"
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen... Dr. Dre!

Dr. Dre
They see that low rider go by, they like, "Oh, my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that six tre like, "Sick 'em, Dre"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me

But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again

I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado

The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like precision collision
Or maico, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

And I take great pleasure in introducing... 50 Cent!

50 Cent
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what?
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, Mafucker, I'm grown

I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what? I trick
Fat ass, burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say, "Move a-bitch, move"

Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece

Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast
Smile for them things, all 42 teeth
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat
Ain't your mama syrup, stickin', usin' my tree
Like taffy but classy, get at me
I'll gladly let you know I wanna kiss

Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'bout clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on, whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

Finn: Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Rachel: Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Finn: A singer in a smoky room
Rachel: A smell of wine and cheap perfume
Both: For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Rachel: Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Both: Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Rachel: Some will win, some will lose
Both: Some are born to sing the blues
And oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, livin' just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Hold on to that feelin'

So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man

So please, don't mess up the trick, hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask, someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch?
Whoa, it's me, baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad real mad Joe Jackson

Oh 'cause, I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, whoa
Am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in a cab 
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right
And I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin'
And I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio 

And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

I put my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxicab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She's gotta be from outta town"

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin'
And I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune

And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight
Something stops me every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel all right

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
And the butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah

You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.I can almost see it 
That dream I'm dreamin', but
But there's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shakin'
But I, I gotta keep tryin'
Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side
It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it but these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on
'Cause

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
But Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side
It's the climb

Yeah

There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waitin on the other side
It's the climb

Yeah-heh-heh-yeay-yeahey

Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith
Baby

Hey, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing, I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you pimpin'

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, dead...

T.I.
Ever had one of them days you wish you would've stayed home?
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get jumped, here that's next
So they don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times, bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down, now ya wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Justin Timberlake and Timbaland
Oh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)

T.I.
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situations
Could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin' smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now I think about "Damn, what a life I had"
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door.
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I had done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
'Cos I hit you and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright 'cause...

Ay, this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here
What you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it)

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

(T.I.)
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.
I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comical

The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
"Where you from? Who you know? What you makin'? What kind of car you in?"
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty

Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are

So live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life (hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life, (ay) my life, (oh) my life (ay)
Just livin' my life, (ay) my life, (oh) my life (ay)

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole team wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life and I'm not stopping

So live your lifeWe were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said...

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes."

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet!"
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, "Please don't go!" 
And I said...

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes."

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you!You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me, have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with meI wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place

And you're still probably workin'
At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence love?
And where's that shiny car?
It didn't ever get you far

And you never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And the truth be told I miss you
And the truth be told I'm lyin'

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tommorow you'll be thinking to yourself:
"Where did I go wrong?"
But the list goes on and on

But the truth be told I miss you
And the truth be told I'm lyin'

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well

(When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell)

(When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell)

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song and you sing along
But you never tell (No, never tell)
Then you're the fool, I just as well
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell (It will give you hell)
When you sing along, I hope that it puts you through hellwill.i.am
